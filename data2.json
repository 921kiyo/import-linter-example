        "output": "To connect immediately with audiences on Google\u2019s feeds, it\u2019s important to create high-quality visual experiences that delight the eye while offering authentic, meaningful messages. Use these three tips to help you drive more sales with up to 3 billion people as they scroll through content on YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.\nYour images will be the first thing people notice when they come across your Discovery ads, so be sure to use the highest possible image resolution. Also, highlight your product or service to help people instantly understand what you\u2019re showcasing.\nTo more accurately illustrate how your products or services work, upload the highest resolution images possible (1200x628, 960x1200, and 1200x1200 pixels) and consider using images that show people using your products. Based on an internal analysis with Creative Works (formerly Unskippable Labs), images with a person drive 4% more clicks compared to images without a person.1\nUse overlay text sparingly. It can have a varied appearance on different devices and create a less compelling experience for people scrolling through their feeds. Our internal analysis with Creative Works shows that, on average, images without overlay text drive 9% more clicks.2\nAudiences, messaging, and creative assets that have performed well for your other media campaigns, such as video or social, can help you unlock performance with highly engaged audiences on Discovery ads. Be sure to include at least 10 converting Search campaign keywords in each of your custom intent audiences, and make the most of Google\u2019s automated audience features: Advertisers who use audience expansion with Discovery ads see 52% more conversions at a comparable cost per acquisition to their originally selected audience.3\nIn summer 2020, U.K. fashion brand Ted Baker used its social ads creative assets to build Discovery campaigns, connecting with previous website visitors and shoppers interested in clothing. As a result, Ted Baker saw a revenue lift of 70% and a 62% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) in under one year.\nAutomated campaign types need the right budget, a variety of great assets, and enough time to analyze the performance of your ads to determine which settings for your creative assets and bids work the best across your audiences. Your campaign optimizes your settings for peak performance over time.\nIf you\u2019re running Discovery ads for the first time, give your campaign time and space to learn what works by choosing an average daily budget at least 10 times the value of your target cost-per-action bid. Then wait for at least 40 conversions before making any changes. Whenever you change your assets, audiences, or bids, your campaign will need two to three weeks to adjust and optimize for the best results.\nFor more detailed examples and tips for how to set up Discovery ads, check out our full best practices guide."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in the entertainment industry. Here, actor, author, and advocate Selma Blair explains why it\u2019s time for media to shift toward a world where everyone sees themselves represented and how to build belonging into media. A version of this article first appeared in Variety on July 19, 2022.\nStorytelling is powerful. Stories can ultimately shape your identity and how the world sees you.\nThroughout my life, my story has been told by other people: Manic depressive. Drunk. Mean.\nIn my memoir, \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I wrote about never feeling a sense of belonging. Throughout my life, I often felt disconnected from my body, out of control, as if I didn\u2019t belong in my own skin. I learned not to show or talk about pain because I didn\u2019t want it to define me, nor did I understand what my pain meant.\nIn 2018, I was finally able to tell other people how I identified myself: disabled. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and learned it had been attacking my central nervous system for years. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have anyone in the entertainment industry to look up to who had a disability or was open about their diagnosis, and I didn\u2019t see my experiences reflected in the stories being told on screen. Even though it was difficult learning I had MS, at least it had a name now. After being confused about who I was for so long, I finally understood myself \u2014 and I belonged to a community. In a way, it was also freeing.\nI started thinking more about the power of storytelling and why representation in media matters. If I had seen and heard from people who were like me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone. Perhaps if I\u2019d had more diverse representation to look up to, I would have learned about my own diagnosis earlier on (I was shocked when I learned one of my idols, Joan Didion, also had MS).\nNow I truly feel comfortable embracing all parts of my identity \u2014 including my disability \u2014 and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time we shift the story about how disabled people are represented. It\u2019s one of the reasons I started looking at the work Google has been doing to build inclusive practices into its marketing. United by shared values and a vision that authentically represents disabled people\u2019s stories, I want to help the rest of the creative industry use Google\u2019s learnings to build a world where everyone belongs.\nSince my diagnosis, I\u2019ve become close friends with Andra\u00e9a LaVant, a leading voice in the disability community and founder of LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and communications firm. I\u2019ve learned so much from her and her team and the work they\u2019ve been doing with brands, including how they\u2019ve supported Google to bring disability into its advertising and internal programs. All In, Google\u2019s inclusive marketing toolkit, draws on years of internal insights and collaborations to build intentionality into every step of its advertising process.\nIn partnership with LaVant Consulting and many other leading organizations, Google launched an accessible marketing playbook on All In as a practical guide for every marketing effort. This is such a powerful resource for so many reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s informed by the lived experiences of people with disabilities.\nThis approach deeply reflects a core principle in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. Who better to build a strong sense of belonging for disabled people than we who belong to the community?\nWhile I want to use my voice to support the disability community, I also strongly believe that I can\u2019t be the only spokesperson for everyone with a disability. Our experience is ours alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pull in as many people and experts from the community as possible.\nIn addition to LaVant Consulting, Google has worked with Disability:IN, GLAAD, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Ad Council, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (The 4A\u2019s), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, Cannes Lions, and many other expert organizations across the world to create All In and contribute to Google\u2019s continued inclusivity practice.\nThis level of collaboration creates space for the more than 1 billion disabled people around the world. It also acknowledges that each person has a unique background and set of circumstances. My disability is just one identity, and my experience is just that \u2014 one person\u2019s experience. Disability will touch everyone at some point in their life, whether permanent, temporary, visible, invisible, or age related. Partnering with diverse experts and perspectives also emphasizes the opportunity to consider people\u2019s whole identities, including gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education.\nThis matters beyond advertising, All In\u2019s original focus. There is a movement happening, and the entertainment industry needs to be a part of this cultural shift. Everyone benefits from accessibility, because it opens up work to a wider, more diverse audience.\nI\u2019ve already learned a lot through the accessible marketing playbook on All In; it would have been a helpful resource while I was writing \u201cMean Baby.\u201d For example, throughout my memoir I described people as \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair.\u201d The playbook suggests that a more inclusive description would be \u201cwheelchair user\u201d or \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d This is a great example of something that may seem small, yet is so impactful.\nAll In also taught me that disability inclusion is a mindset, not a box to check. It requires a sustained commitment, a constantly evolving work process, and ongoing learning for each and every one of us. This is important for us to remember if we\u2019re to make meaningful change.\nIn \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I write that the thing about limitations is that they aren\u2019t really about you at all. They\u2019re often constructed by others, and when they\u2019re removed, you realize that all this time you\u2019ve been capable of soaring.\nThe entertainment industry has the ability to do so much to help tear down these limitations. Committing to accessibility breaks down barriers, enabling creatives to be better in their work. It\u2019s time for the wider creative media industry to commit to inclusion and elevate the significance of this growing cultural shift. Everyone deserves to have their story represented authentically and feel a sense of belonging.\nWhether you\u2019re a producer, creator, marketer, or actor, All In is for you. These are steps anybody can take today. Commit to helping change the creative industry to be more inclusive by learning how on Google.com/All-In."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Data analytics should be top of mind for every advertiser, but building a successful and effective analytics team can be challenging. Here, Google marketing and analytics leaders break down key principles businesses can use to realize the potential of a tech-savvy analytics team.\nDigital transformation \u2014 the process of using digital technologies to modernize business performance, agility, and sustainability \u2014 is widely seen by marketing leaders as the key to future-proofing organizations. To get the most out of digital innovations, companies must be able to pinpoint where to focus their efforts and to understand what strategies are working best. That\u2019s why a strong data analytics team that can communicate real-time data insights to the C-suite is crucial to driving meaningful digital transformation.\nCompanies that build a successful analytics team are more likely to see revenue, profit, and market share gains.1 Yet, according to the Digital Maturity Benchmark, only 9% of businesses use insights and technology effectively to create better consumer experiences. Why?\nThrough Google\u2019s own experience building world-leading analytics teams and our work with hundreds of other companies, we\u2019ve identified three core principles that can help businesses overcome challenges and build successful analytics strategies and teams.\nWhen it comes to investing in your organization\u2019s analytics, prioritize people over tools. Investing in people leads to a flexible analytics capability, which can adapt to a changing business environment without locking the organization into an unwieldy system of software and tools.\nWhile many Fortune 500 companies have made great investments in analytics tools, most still struggle to make meaningful data-driven business decisions. That\u2019s largely because this investment strategy makes the mistake of thinking that tools, rather than people, are the solution to building better analytics. The tools themselves can only go so far without the right people behind them.\nThese misplaced efforts led us to develop a 10/90 rule for web analytics success: Invest 10% of the analytics budget in tools and the remaining 90% in people. For example, if you\u2019re paying a web analytics vendor $25,000 for an annual contract, you should be prepared to invest a further $225,000 in people to get meaningful value from that data.\nTo be sure, software systems and vendor professional services are important components of a successful analytics team. But it\u2019s the analysts, not the tools, who transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the 10/90 rule, CxOs can draw on the winning combination of computer processing power and human judgment to inform marketing activities and business decisions, and understand consumer behaviors.\nAnalytics teams thrive in dynamic environments that reward curiosity, encourage innovation, and set high expectations. Building and reinforcing this type of culture can help put organizations on a path to earning impactful returns from analytics investments.\nAn active analytics culture thrives when CxOs reward curiosity over perfection. Encourage analysts to challenge convention and ask questions as a method to improve quality and reduce risks. This thinking goes hand in hand with a test-and-learn mentality, where pushing boundaries through proactive experimentation helps identify what works, and optimize accordingly.\nIt\u2019s also important to create a culture where failure and success are celebrated equally. Giving airtime to what went wrong allows the team to more effectively learn from their mistakes and see that perfection is an unhealthy pipe dream. This encourages an environment that holds analysts accountable for delivering quality processes and results, further helping to mitigate risk and improve marketing programs.\nHigh-performing analytics capabilities cannot and will not happen without the full commitment of an organization\u2019s senior leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that leaders collaborate with analysts to understand the data behind decision-making.\nC-level leaders can create an analytics-friendly environment by knowing when to collect data, presenting business challenges to analyst teams, and consistently seeking to quantify goals and objectives. Leading by example, data-savvy CxOs can show leaders that it\u2019s better to go to analyst teams with problems to solve rather than requests for specific deliverables, championing these non-analysts to be experts in their distinct businesses \u2014 rather than analytics.\nMaintaining a winning analytics capability requires endorsement up and down an organization. This sets the tone for a company that values understanding measurement solutions as well as the problem-solving expertise analysts can deliver across the organization.\nNow\u2019s the time for businesses to establish a data-centric culture that positions them to win with analytics today and in the future. Companies that do it are more effective and efficient, earn impactful insights from their data, and can attract and retain top-tier analytics talent.\nSo start laying the foundation for your company\u2019s in-house data analytics infrastructure immediately. Audit your organization\u2019s current analytics capabilities to identify gaps and opportunities in your marketing strategy. Then, identify what leadership you need to close gaps in capability and design by successfully implementing the principles we\u2019ve shared.\nBuild your organization\u2019s own high-performing analytics team, and join the future-ready businesses that are taking their marketing further."

        "input": "",
        "output": "While some brands are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their messaging and marketing campaigns, an essential component of inclusivity may be missing: accessibility.\nIt's especially important to cater to people who are typically underserved in the digital world. For example, people who are blind or have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, are neurodivergent, or those who have motor conditions. These individuals often face barriers when an experience is not properly designed. Online journeys are often convoluted experiences for people, and brands need to ensure their apps and websites don\u2019t add further complications.\nBuilding accessible user experiences will soon become a regulatory requirement too. This year, European Union member states are adopting the European Accessibility Act into their laws. The expectation is that all products and online services will need to be accessible once the requirements come into force in 2025.\nSo where do you start on your accessibility journey? We\u2019ve spoken with four brands about how they think about and build for accessibility and disability inclusiveness. Here\u2019s what we learned.\nAdvertising is powerful because it connects with people through storytelling. But what if someone misses key elements of that story? This question led consumer goods manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G) to incorporate audio description, a voice-over describing what\u2019s happening, into their video ads.\n\u201cThe introduction of audio description stems from my personal experiences,\u201d explains Sam Latif, company accessibility leader at P&G, who is blind. \u201cI was in a meeting when an ad for Flash played, but all I could hear was the song \u2018Flash\u2019 by Queen. What I didn\u2019t realize was that a dog was singing that song, because, without audio description, I couldn\u2019t understand the humor of the ad.\u201d\nThe P&G team worked with The Royal National Institute of Blind People to learn how audio description is done and integrated it into its ads.\nP&G didn\u2019t stop there. In 2021, they launched the first audio-described Super Bowl ad. It also ran its first adaptive audio description trial in the U.K. This means applying audio description to TV ads that don\u2019t have enough natural gaps in the dialogue to provide a description. And, most recently, it added audio description to its YouTube channel.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have all the answers but are proud of the progress we have made,\u201d says Latif. \u201cExperiences like this have led to change, with audio description opening up our advertising to millions more people around the world.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway conducts research directly with people with disabilities, from customers who are blind or have low vision to those with nonvisible disabilities, such as dyslexia. Its goal: understand people\u2019s first-hand experiences when using the delivery app and build inclusive products.\n\u201cObserving people with access needs using our app has been a strong facilitator of change and awareness across the organization,\u201d says Naoil Sbai, a global research team lead at the company. \u201cIt helped us realize the impact that simple changes could make. And it made us rethink how people interact with our app.\u201d\nThis motivated the research team to identify optimization opportunities with the Android Accessibility Scanner. The automated tool flagged key recommendations, such as increasing the size of touch targets \u2014 the tappable space around a navigation button.\nOnce this issue was known, it took them just a day to make the touch targets bigger. Something seemingly small \u2014 and a quick fix \u2014 can make a world of difference to customers, especially those with limited dexterity. And, as a bonus, this makes it easier for anyone to order their food quickly while on-the-go.\nL'Or\u00e9al had accessibility front of mind when building its new website. \u201cThe first step toward accessibility is to understand the different types of disabilities and how they affect millions of people,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Cunche, the beauty company\u2019s digital project director.\nWhen it learned how customers with low vision and cognitive conditions use the website, it set out to raise awareness within the company. It adopted the industry-standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to improve the website experience. And it partnered with an agency that specializes in this topic to help implement the guidelines across the business.\nWith the basic foundations in place, the product team took it one step further by layering on additional features. For example, they now offer accessibility controls in the website navigation menu, so people can select settings based on their needs.\nThe first feature is high-contrast mode. This removes background images and allows people to view the site in a strong white-on-black contrast, making it easier to read and focus on the content.\nThe team also added an option to deactivate animations to reveal a static header image on the page instead. This can help people with vestibular disorders, for whom motion can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea.\n\u201cAfter several tests and user surveys, all results are very positive and encourage us to go further,\u201d continues Cunche. \u201cWith knowledge comes responsibility, and only then can we create a better digital experience \u2014 for everyone.\u201d\nBooking.com is a large and complex organization, with many teams working on different elements of the digital travel company\u2019s app. As different people, code, and designs feed into the app, some features don\u2019t always behave as they should.\nFor example, during testing, the accessibility team found that some navigational tabs were not working correctly with screen readers \u2014 software that reads visual information from the screen out loud. In some instances, the screen reader would read out the wrong tab. Someone wanting to navigate to the \u201cCar Rentals\u201d section could be accidentally directed to the \u201cTaxis\u201d page.\nThe accessibility team partnered with the design systems team to update the components \u2014 the building blocks within an app \u2014 so that accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, were built in from the start.\n\u201cIf we use components that are accessible by default, we can innovate and be agile, without having to focus on getting it right all the time, every time,\u201d explains Booking.com Engineering Manager and Accessibility Lead Parham Doustdar. Doustdar has been blind since birth and is an expert at navigating websites and apps with screen readers, so this accessibility issue was very familiar to him.\nHowever, this work didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, because some legacy components did not reflect the changes. The team partnered with another group in their organization to update the technology so the accessibility changes could be adopted throughout the entire app. Now, as pages are built and updated, everyone working on the app automatically uses components that have accessibility built in.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter how accessible your components are if no one is using them,\u201d continues Doustdar. \u201cYou have to harness existing initiatives, where possible, and partner with other teams to increase adoption.\u201d\nHere are some final tips to help you improve accessibility.\nAnd, above all, know that people\u2019s varied needs continue to change, so you\u2019re never finished creating more accessible user experiences. The most important thing is to start."

It\u2019s only natural that marketing and creative teams develop their own \u201crules\u201d about what makes for effective creative on YouTube ads. We often find that those rules could benefit from a reframe. The truth is, successful brands on YouTube use creative strategies and mindsets that bust assumptions. Here are a few misperceptions we've encountered and some suggestions for how you might reframe them into best practices for YouTube ad creative.\nYou should absolutely take risks on YouTube. But that doesn\u2019t mean shooting in the dark to find what works. There are some basic principles to making effective YouTube ads, and these principles can inform which risks are worth taking. The ABCDs of effective creative on YouTube are based on years of research on tens of thousands of ads from all over the world to uncover which specific creative elements contribute to the biggest impact on YouTube.\nAds that follow the ABCDs as a guide have been shown to yield 30% lift in short-term sales likelihood and 17% lift in long-term brand contribution.1 There\u2019s still plenty of room to build creatively on those foundations, but keeping them in mind will better equip you to take those risks and make more effective creative choices.\nWhile there are certainly creative principles you can start with, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to execution. Looking at the wide spectrum of effective YouTube ads across marketing objectives around the world, we\u2019ve found that focusing on what your ad says and how it makes people feel is more important than the way your ad looks.\nEffective YouTube ads can be many things, like an episodic docu-series, an undercover investigation, a user-narrated product review, or an interview with the CEO. It can be a music video partnership with a YouTube creator that becomes the No. 1 most-watched video in the world in its first 24 hours, leading to a 100% increase in year-over-year sales. It can even be an anime series starring the product as the hero, which sells out immediately, beats the team\u2019s KPIs, and boosts year-over-year product sales by more than 100%.\nYouTube is a breeding ground for creativity, and advertisers have as much of an opportunity to participate in that as anyone else on the platform. Effective ads give viewers a taste of your brand, product, or service \u2014 and that leaves a lot of room for creativity.\nSometimes ads that are meant to drive action get a bad rap. There\u2019s concern that lower-funnel ads cheapen the story or sell the brand short. But we\u2019ve seen brands get really creative with calls to action. It just requires thinking about the ad as the start of the viewer\u2019s next action, allowing the work to extend beyond that one impression. This is especially important on YouTube where 63% of viewers in the markets we\u2019ve studied say they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on the platform.2\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, AR, AU, BR, CA, CL, CO, FR, IT IN, JP, MX, PE, KR, ES, U.K., U.S., Why Video study, n=32075, A18-64 gen pop video users, March 2020\u2013Aug. 2020.\nA creative way to customize lower-funnel ads is to align with the viewer\u2019s passion points and make a more directed offer. Or you could employ a bit of reverse psychology like McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia did, when the team told viewers not to search for a product, knowing that would spark curiosity and encourage them to do just that.\nGucci U.K. got creative with ad sequencing to hone in on viewers most interested in its products as part of its holiday season campaign. Partnering with filmmaker Harmony Korine, the team produced a colorful, nostalgia-tinged video ad. With ad sequencing, they first raised awareness by featuring a campaign teaser video that led to the full director's cut on YouTube. Then, to increase consideration, Gucci showed a 6-second bumper ad series to viewers who showed interest in the teaser. Finally, the brand served product-focused ads to those viewers using TrueView for action and TrueView for shopping ads that connected them directly with the link to purchase. The campaign itself was viewed 5.4 million times globally with a 58% view completion rate, and it drove 44.5K clicks to Gucci\u2019s website.\nThere\u2019s a difference between having an experimental approach to creating video ads and conducting a one-off test. The former is a mindset that reaps deep learnings and keeps you from relying on long-held assumptions. The latter is a thing you do every once in a while, and works best for campaign-specific learnings.\nAn experimental mindset doesn\u2019t have to slow you down or cost you more, and it will pay off in the long term. Think of every campaign your brand puts out there as an experiment. See what you learn, which new questions emerge, and what needs to be optimized. Advertisers who successfully used Video Experiments saw 60% higher ad recall from the better performing creative.3\nSource: Google Data, Global, Successful Video Experiments were those with a significant difference in Brand Lift between experiment arms, 2019\u20132020.\nStart by changing one variable (big or small), like simple edits to the pace, the framing of your opening shot, or a variety of copy tweaks. Even the smallest changes can make a big impact. The more you experiment, the more you will understand not only what levers to pull creatively for your brand, but deeper insights about your audience.\nAspiration, a digital banking alternative focused on social good, has taken an experimental mindset when it comes to video creative. The team consistently tests through the entire production process. They run ads with variants of headlines, calls to action, and even landing pages to fully optimize their creative for success. By running different versions and looking at Brand Lift and Search lift results, they\u2019re able to determine the more effective creative to put their weight behind. Thanks to these optimizations and experiments, Aspiration was able to drive a 25% lift in relative brand awareness, over 16,000 email leads, and more than 3,400 new users.\nCreating assets tailored for each platform usually requires more lift than most brands and creative teams can spare. What we\u2019ve found is that when you start with a digital audience in mind, by grabbing attention immediately; building for mobile with tighter framing, large-type text, and color contrast for visibility on smaller screens; and with sound on, your ads will perform better everywhere, including on TV.\nThen for YouTube in particular, layer on some of its specific capabilities like personalizing your video ads at scale, like the Greek pizza chain Pizza Fan, or transforming a TV spot into a multipart video ad using ad sequencing, like LinkedIn U.K.\nIn its first ever brand-led campaign, LinkedIn U.K. had a beautiful 60-second TV spot. The team devised a test. They would run the TV spot on YouTube to see how it performed, and they would also run tailored-for-YouTube assets: four separate short-form videos that featured a large on-screen logo, with sound on, and sequenced together to serve to viewers over time. Hands down, the YouTube-tailored assets performed better. \u201cWe saw increased consideration by 20%, ad recall up 178%, and a campaign that was 2.3X more cost efficient in driving brand lift,\u201d said Katriona O\u2019Leary, the brand\u2019s group manager for paid media.\nGreat brands around the world are constantly pushing to rethink long-held assumptions about what works on YouTube. Follow the foundational principles of effective creative, think creatively, build for digital, and take advantage of the capabilities YouTube offers \u2014 all with an experimental mindset \u2014 and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making effective video ad creative.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio. Create with Google curates the creative insight, inspiration, and tools you need to make effective creative work \u2014 all in one place."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dorothea Wiesmann Rothuizen and Wojtek Skut are engineers at Google, where they work on continually improving AI and large language models. They are a part of the team implementing new capabilities into Google Ads features, such as broad match.\nThere\u2019s been a wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, largely due to immense improvements in the underlying technology. Large language models (LLMs), for example, now enable a deeper understanding of language, which has led to conversations with AI that are much more natural and intuitive.\nThis same technology has supercharged broad match, a Google Ads setting that helps brands reach more people with their ads and reduces manual keyword work.\nWhile broad match has existed since the dawn of Google Ads, its early version wasn\u2019t perfect and began losing momentum about 15 years ago. Back then, it could have matched a search query, such as \u201ctreating a pet at home,\u201d to an irrelevant keyword, like \u201ctreats for pets.\u201d At the same time, \u201ctreating a pet at home\u201d would not have matched to the related \u201cwithout a vet,\u201d since the two phrases don\u2019t contain any of the same words. But, thanks to new advances in AI and continuous updates, broad match has evolved and can now better interpret nuance and context.\nIn fact, today\u2019s broad match understands people\u2019s search queries on a deeper level and can identify keyword search intent. This makes it one of the most effective solutions for search advertising.\nBelieve it or not, when broad match first launched, Google\u2019s engineering team would manually write out the synonyms for a keyword and cast a really wide net. For example, an ad keyword including \u201ccheap\u201d could match with searches for \u201cinexpensive\u201d and \u201cshoestring.\u201d While \u201cshoestring\u201d can be a different way of saying \u201cbudget,\u201d a user could alternatively use this word to search for shoelaces.\nThanks to new AI capabilities, LLMs can now better understand a user\u2019s search intent. We train them with billions of pieces of text so they can learn all the different variations and meanings of a word or phrase, and what sequences make sense. Once that fundamental foundation is in place, we will assign the AI a specific task, like matching ads to search queries.\nWhile the language technology can understand the potential demand that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s most effective when combined with Smart Bidding. This automated bidding strategy factors in a wide range of signals and surrounding data points in a privacy-safe way \u2014 such as search history, interests, and past purchases \u2014 to build a predictive model that helps advertisers identify the audiences most likely to convert.\nHere are three of the most significant improvements we\u2019ve made to broad match.\nIn the early days of broad match, the technology would connect the dots between keywords in a search query and an ad, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the order of the words in the query into account.\nFor instance, someone looking for a flight from London to Paris could have been shown an ad for a flight from Paris to London. To prevent this from happening, Google\u2019s search specialists would\u2019ve recommended a different keyword strategy to those advertisers. But today, broad match knows that going from A to B isn\u2019t the same as going from B to A. This improvement has also been applied to other areas where a search query only works one way.\nHere\u2019s an example. A user might be looking for a place to \u201cexchange euros to pounds\u201d or searching for a \u201cusb to usbc cable,\u201d and seeing an ad in which these words are in reverse order would not be relevant to them. Fortunately, the latest version of broad match now understands their search intent.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve often been asked: \u201cWhat happens when two ads for the same advertiser match to the same search query?\u201d Previously, broad match would have looked at an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank to help determine which ad to show, but which may not always have been the best choice.\nTo improve relevance \u2014 for advertisers and users \u2014 today\u2019s broad match considers supporting information, such as other keywords in the ad group and even the ad\u2019s landing page. And, thanks to the increased capabilities of the LLM that powers broad match, it better understands the meaning of a search query and its variations to improve relevance there too.\nMultilingual search is a third area that has seen a lot of development. Broad match now recognizes that some people might switch between languages when looking for something online, and it uses that information to serve the right ads.\nThe expat community is a common use case. For example, Turkish people living in the Netherlands or British people residing in Spain may be searching in their first language but looking for local-language results for the country they live in.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that running your campaign in one language means that you\u2019ll get traffic for other languages, since campaign success still relies on language settings and localized creative. But, in countries where many people are bilingual, it\u2019s helpful to know that broad match can match relevant, local traffic to an ad, even when the search is made in another language.\nBroad match may not be quite as old as \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d but it\u2019s been around for a long time. And, just like in the iconic 1985 movie, it shows us that sometimes looking at something from the past helps you understand its value in the present.\nThat said, while AI-powered language upgrades have made broad match far more effective for search advertising, it will continue to need a smart marketer in the driver\u2019s seat. Savvy marketers will check performance, select the right bidding strategy, and monitor new queries identified by broad match to bring in new customers. After all, you might discover new insights about your audience throughout the campaign.\nAI learns from you, and you learn from AI. Broad match\u2019s success depends on the team that uses it, just like the time-traveling car from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d needed the input and creativity from its creator, Doc Brown, to drive into the past \u2014 and the future.Tune into the Google Marketing Platform Partner Podcast episode \u201cTalking AI: How a deeper language understanding is transforming broad match\u201d to hear more about the ways large language models are supercharging broad match.

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s business environment, planning ahead simply isn\u2019t enough. Marketers need to balance early planning with an ability to pivot. Especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty when budgets are under pressure, marketing and finance teams must work together even more closely to effectively deploy resources and maximize ROI.\nAn ingrained benefit of digital marketing has always been the ability to quickly change media plans and constantly optimize. More than ever, marketers have to lean into an agile mindset to shift budgets to the biggest opportunities. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy task.\nIn my past CMO roles at Calvin Klein Inc. and L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, I remember how often industry media buying platforms were distinctly siloed by channel: search, online video, display, social, and more. These silos carried over to our budget and organizational structures, creating friction and inefficiency whenever we tried to optimize performance across many marketing channels.\nBut as technology and solutions like AI and machine learning have rapidly improved, so have opportunities to show up for customers in more connected and consistent ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a multiplying force for businesses. You can more precisely scale your marketing presence across channels, stay on top of consumer needs and trends, and achieve new levels of agility within your marketing.\nThese opportunities are empowering marketers to rethink their old approaches to multichannel digital campaigns to improve ROI. To better understand this shift, Google partnered with Kantar to survey over 2,400 global marketers and explore the importance of agility in planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels. From this study, we\u2019ve identified three core areas that require a careful balancing act to unlock greater agility and developed guiding principles for success.\nWhile initial budget planning is considered fundamental, marketers should also leave room for flexibility. In our study, marketers are considered behaviorally budget agile if they adjust budgets across digital channels on a weekly or more frequent basis. Based on this metric, nearly a quarter of the marketers surveyed are considered budget agile.1\nBudget agile does not, however, mean unprepared. Thirty-one percent of budget-agile marketers engage in formal marketing planning to align on strategy and digital-media budget allocations every month versus 18% of non-agile marketers.2\nBeing budget agile can also lead to better business outcomes. Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 And 48% of budget-agile marketers state that their marketing performance exceeded internal expectations and marketing KPIs, compared to 33% of marketers who are not budget agile.4\nThis finding did surprise us: Many of the marketers surveyed considered themselves more budget agile than they actually are based on their budgeting behaviors. On average, 60% of marketers who say they are \u201cextremely agile\u201d only make budget adjustments across digital channels monthly or less frequently.5\nWhile this gap between perception and actual behavior happens at all levels of an organization, C-level executives are 2X more likely than individual contributors to perceive their business as extremely budget agile.6\nThe disconnect between perceived and actual budget agility reveals that there\u2019s room for improvement across organizations. For me personally, empowering my teams to work with greater agility means I need to step back and allow them to make faster decisions. But this isn\u2019t the case for many businesses. Indeed, the budget approval process is quite lengthy for 54% of non-agile marketers, where changes to digital budgets of 20% or more take a month or longer for approval.7 And even agile marketers must deal with time-consuming approvals. For 59% of budget-agile marketers, changes to digital budget of 20% or more take a week or longer for approval.8\nMarketers also face heavy oversight and scrutiny over budget changes and reallocations. Fifty-two percent of marketers say that executive or C-level individuals have a heavy influence on budget adjustments after the initial planning period.9\nFortunately, our research shows that companies don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes to become more budget agile. Even brands and agencies that invest in dedicated channel expertise and specialist teams can still achieve quick wins to drive better collaboration and results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to break down organizational silos. Fifty-eight percent of marketers have created more cross-channel team touchpoints, such as meetings, training, and information sharing to improve collaboration.10 And, compared to their non-agile peers, budget-agile marketers are twice as likely to call their marketing across channels \u201cvery tightly integrated.\u201d11\nThey\u2019re also leaning into their agency partnerships to stay on the cutting edge. Agencies can help encourage an agile mindset when it comes to budgeting and breaking down organizational silos.\nForty-two percent of budget-agile marketers say their agency partners greatly influence adjustments they make after initial budget planning, compared to only 31% of non-agile marketers.12\nNext, more teams are setting shared goals that allow them to take a results-first rather than a channel-first approach. This starts with implementing consistent measurement and success metrics that help marketers align on a common language, even when they work on different channels. In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed have instituted shared metrics and KPIs across channels to improve collaboration.13\nMarketers are also relying on Google AI to maximize budget agility across channels in real time. Budget-agile marketers are 29% more likely than non-agile marketers to use cross-channel automation.14\nOne example of this is demonstrated by the global streaming service Discovery+, which adopted Performance Max to improve how the brand optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. Regina Sommese, group vice president of paid media and global subscriber acquisitions at Discovery+, says, \u201cBeing budget fluid has always been critical for us, but the process has historically been manual. Performance Max allowed us to move away from managing siloed campaigns to one holistic optimization approach.\u201d\nAs global brands like Discovery+ have found, driving reliable results and creating a culture of experimentation don\u2019t have to be at odds. In fast-changing environments, marketers who can strike the right balance between investing in proven strategies and funding experiments that unlock new opportunities will deliver long-term growth. In fact, 31% of budget-agile marketers say it\u2019s \u201cvery easy\u201d to get additional budget to start new tests that weren\u2019t included in the initial media budget, compared to just 9% of non-agile marketers.15\nIn times of uncertainty, it can also be a natural instinct to become more conservative and pull back on marketing budgets. Only 17% of budget-agile marketers and 6% of non-agile marketers have channels with uncapped or unlimited budgets that make it easy to increase budgets for new opportunities.16\nInside Google\u2019s own marketing team, we\u2019re taking the exact opposite approach. We\u2019ve partnered with our finance teams to prove the incremental value of marketing by aligning marketing goals with real business outcomes, like profitability and customer lifetime value. We also reforecast our global budgets regularly to ensure that we can request more funds if we have room to scale successful tests against finance-approved ROI thresholds. This gives us greater freedom to avoid artificial \u201ccaps\u201d on digital media budgets that can limit our ability to improve results.\nAgile marketers help their teams move faster, pivot to take advantage of new performance opportunities, and ultimately drive more business growth. By finding the right balance across budget agility, cross-channel team collaboration, and experimentation, marketers can invest their resources more effectively to maximize ROI."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in advertising. Here, KR Liu, Google\u2019s head of brand accessibility, shares her personal story and why accessible marketing is critical for every brand.\nI am female, queer, and disabled. For much of my life, these parts of my identity were rarely, if ever, authentically represented in media and advertising. This made me feel different, unvalued, and alone. As a result, I spent more than a decade hiding who I was in my personal life and at work.\nThen, a few years ago, I began to recognize that each part of my identity was essential and that no one part could exist without the other. It was the first time I felt as though people cared about all of me, rather than only my disability. That feeling was transformative.\nSadly, many others can relate to my experience of not feeling fully seen and represented in society, or in brand advertising. Great ads should reflect everyone, including the 1 billion people worldwide who identify as disabled and control 8 trillion dollars in spending. They should also acknowledge intersectionality, because like me, every disabled person has many dimensions to their identity that make them, them.\nSource: The World Bank, Global, April 2022.\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a day job that focuses on improving the accessibility of Google\u2019s marketing for our billions of users. While accessibility has always been core to our company\u2019s mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 being truly accessible is a journey, and we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to improve, and we are hoping to help other brands improve too.\nA year ago, we shared Google.com/All-In, an inclusive marketing toolkit for brands and agencies. Today, I\u2019m excited to share that All In now includes an all-new playbook on accessible marketing, which we developed in partnership with LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN, and has been endorsed by the American Association of Ad Agencies, Ad Council, Cannes Lions, and many other leading organizations.\nThe playbook has meaningfully guided our marketing this past year, and is the result of yearslong research and collaboration across many accessibility topics \u2014 from web experience to authentic depictions of people with disabilities. We\u2019re sharing it publicly with the hope it will improve the representation of disabled people in the media and help create work that is fully accessible. And, here, I\u2019m sharing three core principles from the playbook, with hope that it will inspire you to visit All In to learn more.\nDisabled people are their own experts, which is why it\u2019s so important to bring in their voices from the start. Often this involves dedicating the resources required to do accessible marketing right, such as training and support for internal teams.\nFor many companies, this may also involve leaning on a specialized third party for guidance. At Google, we sought out partnerships with several experts in disability inclusion, including LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN. Partnerships like these allow you show allyship and engage directly with the disabled community, which helps to expand the ideas that fuel your work.\nFor marketing to feel truly inclusive and accessible, brands must think about people with disabilities holistically, and consider the full spectrum of markers that comprise identity. Beyond disability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education level are just a few of the additional ways that people may identify themselves.\nFailing to recognize and reflect intersectionality in your messages runs the risk of reducing disabled people\u2019s multidimensional identities into oversimplified stories that can perpetuate stereotypes, rather than uplifting them. An excellent rule of thumb is to always opt for nuanced narratives, preferably ones that come directly from the people who are part of the narrative.\nOne example of this is our campaign, \u201cA CODA Story,\u201d which shares the multigenerational personal experience of Tony Lee, an Asian American Googler and a child of deaf adults (CODA). The film portrays Lee and his family as they bridge gaps in distance and communication during the pandemic by using Google\u2019s assistive technologies.\nBest practices for disability inclusion and accessibility marketing change over time as technology evolves and culture shifts. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey that depends heavily on the needs of people with disabilities. Like other forms of inclusion, accessibility should be a constant commitment that\u2019s embedded into every aspect of your brand campaigns \u2014 from conception to execution, and beyond.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on accessible marketing, but we recognize that there\u2019s plenty of work ahead. Achieving our accessibility goals is a continual process, and we are perpetually learning from it.\nOne thing we\u2019ve proved over and over again is that accessibility and disability inclusive marketing are good for all people, and the benefits don\u2019t stop there. When everyone can fully access and engage with your products, content, and experiences, it\u2019s good for business. Brands that prioritize this concept as a human and business imperative will find that it opens up their work to a more diverse audience. Committing to accessibility in marketing breaks down barriers and enables brands to be better in their work, which is better for all users.\nTogether, we can drive a cultural shift that represents and celebrates people with disabilities as their whole selves. A world where everyone can see themselves is one where everyone has what they need to thrive."

        "output": "No\u00ebl Paasch, creative director at Google\u2019s Creative Works, leads brand and agency partnerships to determine best practices in advertising on YouTube. Here, she shares results from over two years of research to better understand the effectiveness of food, beverage, and restaurant video ads.\nShould your opening shot feature a satisfied customer enjoying your product mid-bite? Should it set the scene, steadily leading up to the product reveal?\nWhen it comes to creative decisions for video ads, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish pure aesthetics from what drives results. Without hard data, it\u2019s impossible to understand the psychology behind viewers\u2019 responses.\nOur ABCDs for creative effectiveness are data-informed, tested guidelines that can be applied universally to any video ad. In fact, Nielsen found that food, beverage, and restaurant ads that closely followed the ABCDs saw, on average, 31% higher sales lift.1 Supported by third-party research, our team recently conducted additional analyses to uncover more actionable creative insights around food ads. Here\u2019s what they found.\nThe experience of food is so much more than just its taste. A chocolate chip cookie is just as much its salty-sweet, fresh-from-the-oven smell, iconic craggy texture, and gooey chocolate melting on your fingers as it is its flavor. Our analysis shows that you can engage both sight and sound to make up for the lack of other sensory details.\nTake Magnum Ruby\u2019s ad, for example. When the protagonist takes a big bite of the chocolate-coated ice cream, the sound effect of the chocolate layer shattering evokes the experience of biting into a Magnum ice cream. Together, sight and sound are more compelling than either sense would be alone, summoning the memory of smell and taste.\nIt goes without saying that texture plays a big role in the characterization of any food. Would fresh pizza be as appealing without its gooey cheese or soft, bready crust?\nResearch shows that the majority of viewers watch ads on their mobile devices, so conveying the full visual through close-up shots of the product is extra important. Clear, crisp visuals help to communicate the product benefit quickly. This is generally good advice for any vertical on YouTube, but especially for food, beverage, and restaurant brands.\nC\u00f4te d'Or used this technique to great effect in their holiday ad. In each shot of the product, the chocolate takes up the full screen. The sheen of its smooth exterior and the grooves of the nut filling are so vivid, the viewer may as well have the product in front of them.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much one ad can show of the product itself. With limited time, shorter-form ads are perfect for focusing solely on the product, but studies show that long-form ads are more effective when they incorporate a human story. Introducing a human element adds context and makes it easier for the viewer to relate.\nIHop\u2019s \u201cAll You Can Eat Pancakes\u201d campaign included both a short-form and long-form video ad. The 6-second ad featured a single shot of the food itself, while the 15-second ad took advantage of those extra seconds by featuring three different people. No character is shown eating; we don\u2019t even get to see their faces. Yet the actors lend a human touch to the ad. Despite the age-old advice that every food ad needs a bite-and-smile moment, our analysis showed that a range of scenarios performed equally well, from ads that put chewing front-and-center to those in which no one actually ate.\nTry experimenting with varied ad lengths and creative executions to see what performs best with your brand and audiences.\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales lift, the memorability of your brand is as important as the food itself. And when it comes to brand expression, you should pull out all the stops.\nOur research shows that relying on a logo endcard might not be doing the most work for you. To make a lasting impression, think about seamlessly incorporating it throughout the ad, complemented by audio mentions, large type supers, and distinctive brand assets like mascots, brand colors, and mnemonics.\nThis Coca-Cola Vanilla ad does a great job of both subtly and not-so-subtly integrating the brand into all 20 seconds of video. The more your brand appears in the ad spot, the more likely viewers are to remember it.\nLastly, remember that the average viewer\u2019s brain can only retain so much information from any given ad. So when it comes to copy, our data supports using clear, accessible language.\nFor example, try describing the benefit rather than the ingredient. BelVita\u2019s breakfast biscuits are \u201cloaded with energy,\u201d while Special K\u2019s cereal is \u201cfeeding strength to power your moves.\u201d Special K takes the technique a step further by showing how the product helps active people, such as dancers, in their day-to-day lives.\nArmed with these five insights, your team can measurably increase creative effectiveness, making your products and your bottom line even more appetizing. Still, the best way to determine which creative practices support your goals, from awareness to conversion, is to experiment with your own ads and test them yourself."

        "output": "Today, people are spending more time online, and there\u2019s a growing challenge to hold their attention when they land on your site. When you do have their attention, it\u2019s even harder to capture their lead information. Landing pages aren\u2019t always the most popular sign-up forms, but they have the potential to accelerate your lead-generation efforts through effective design, copy, and prospect-acquisition strategy.\nWell-optimized website landing pages should convert prospects into leads. Think of it this way: Your website is like a storefront. A good landing page is a storefront window that welcomes customers by eliminating confusion and improving discoverability. Ultimately, it should convert prospective customers into solid leads.\nAt HubSpot, I\u2019ve worked with many brands over the years to optimize landing pages that deliver results. Here are four principles we use to increase lead generation.\nTo encourage the highest-quality results, landing pages should easily and quickly communicate the value of an offer \u2014 whether it\u2019s a guide, a set of templates, or a virtual event like a webinar. Be clear and avoid jargon. A well-built landing page should tell the audience what they should give in exchange for the content, how it will help solve their problem, and what exactly they\u2019ll get in return. The first impression that your customers will have of your company will come from your landing page, so it\u2019s important to think about your typical customers\u2019 fears and pain points. Be transparent by providing clear, comprehensive information up front \u2014 especially when it comes to factors such as additional fees, which may turn prospects away.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is worth a million. Adding compelling imagery and videos to landing pages helps grab attention and can help improve conversion rates. According to a HubSpot study on landing pages, 30% of top landing pages feature video content. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that imagery should be relevant and enhance the call to action (CTA), instead of driving added confusion.\nThe goal of a landing page is to have prospects hand over the desired information in exchange for the content or offer. Navigation of the page should be kept to a minimum and coupled with a clearly presented CTA to help customers quickly see the value in the page\u2019s offer and products. An action like \u201cDownload\u201d, \u201cSign up\u201d, or an otherwise relevant CTA at the top, middle, and bottom of the landing page can ratchet up more conversions because audiences don\u2019t have to go searching for the next step. Consider a personalized CTA, or smart CTA, which can convert 202% better than default versions.\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s marketing benchmarks report, companies see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. Successful landing page strategies have different pages to target specific audiences depending on where they clicked through from, and they keep each audience\u2019s motivators in mind through the entire page design. Improving relevance for your landing pages with different audiences can also lead to improved ad positioning \u2014 the better the experience your pages provide, the more likely your ads will show up in a higher position. One way to optimize your landing-page audience strategy is with Google Ads campaigns from Google and HubSpot. You can see how your leads perform by measuring key actions in the lead-to-sale journey, importing your offline conversions to understand the full value of the lead, and then using Customer Match to create personalized, meaningful landing page messages for different segments of those leads. Take the example of CallTrackingMetrics. The company synced its offline conversions to identify its most valuable leads and drove a 101% increase in marketing qualified leads.\nTo learn more about how you can help your small business succeed online, check out the new Google for Small Business digital essentials guide and the HubSpot and Google guide to Google Ads."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The marketing industry is entering a new golden age of opportunities, spurred by an unlikely catalyst: third-party cookies.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, industry leaders are making great strides to develop their \u201ccreative intelligence\u201d to reach and engage customers. Creative intelligence can be understood as the ability to customize creative without using third-party data, and then deliver these ads using the latest technologies to reach the right audiences, with the right messages, at the right times. The creative feel relevant and engaging, without the need for any personal data.\nAs we prepare for this new era in a so-called \u201ccookie-less world,\u201d here are three steps organizations can take now to build a privacy-safe creative strategy.\nMarketers must shift away from personalized ads toward a new, future-proof approach. The industry is on the cusp of a \u201ccontextual ads\u201d renaissance; these are ads that can be customized based on easily accessible information \u2014 like the date, time, weather, and even traffic conditions. This information is referred to as \u201ccontextual\u201d data, and it\u2019s been around for years but is often overlooked. These data points can play a huge role in helping marketers craft creative that is relevant and unobtrusive.\nContextual signals available to marketers\nBelgian windshield repair company Carglass recently used this privacy-forward approach to deliver customized video ads that drove impact. The firm delivered ads by using a combination of real-time data \u2014 including the weather and the streaming program a person was watching \u2014 along with first-party data about car ownership status. Contextual data about the user\u2019s country and language preference were also added into the mix. With all these data points, the company was able to serve individual viewers automated ads that were customized for the situation.\nFor example, a French speaker in Brussels watching a funny sitcom who had previously inquired about minor damage to their rear window would be served an upbeat advertisement in French, featuring rear windshield replacement and details about the Carglass service centers closest to them.\nThe ads led to an 89% drop in view-through conversion costs and drove bookings at a low cost per acquisition.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, marketers can adapt to this new creative context by drawing from a base of contextual signals, then adding in first-party data to segment audiences. Marketing teams can then go a step further by introducing statistical models to refine the clustering of audiences and predict future behavior. This allows teams to more effectively deliver relevant ads to the right audiences.\nCreative is sometimes a neglected area of marketing strategy, considered secondary to media buying and ad tech. However, Forrester research shows that shifting marketing budget from technology to creative resources can improve return on investment by up to 18%.\nTo tap into this growth potential, marketers will require both creative investment along with automation. Automated solutions can shuffle up creative assets to deliver highly relevant ads to potential customers, while saving teams precious time and energy.\nEuropean beauty retailer Douglas recently demonstrated how creative and automation can work together to deliver effective, customized ads. The company set up a campaign to reach website visitors who had provided their first-party data, and also included a wider audience of like-minded people by harnessing Google\u2019s Affinity Audiences. From there, Douglas used contextual signals to deliver ads to online pages their audiences were viewing, but they featured ads only on pages that included specific keywords.\nThe beauty of this campaign was that the company delivered these ads with automated, customized creative. People who were considered \u201chigh-potential\u201d and more likely to invest in premium products \u2014 based on first-party data and the pages they visited \u2014 were shown relevant ads for high-end beauty brands and products. Douglas aimed to improve the average order value of these loyal customers. Other audience members were shown ads aligned with their interests in either makeup, perfume, or skin care, and the featured products had lower prices. The creative assets and products were automatically swapped around to make the ads feel deeply relevant to customers.\nExample of makeup ad (left) and premium ad (right) from Douglas\nTwo animated ads for beauty products from Douglas cycle through images of a white woman modeling the nail polish, moisturizer, bronzer, blush, and anti-aging products featured.\nCreative workflows need updating in this new era. Teams need to move from a linear process to a continuous feedback loop.\nContinuous feedback loop\nThis creative workflow process involves creating dynamic ad templates where creative elements can be added and combined according to live signals, in real time. Then technologies such as Cloud Vision API can analyze visual elements and identify which approaches work best, for example, showing a person in an ad or simply showing the product. With some experimentation and testing, customer insights will build over time and new creative elements can be added into the mix and used in the ad templates. It\u2019s all about continuous, automated improvements to create the most relevant ads.\nA recent report from BCG outlines that a major airline took this approach and built a \u201cdynamic content factory.\u201d The team added between 20 to 40 new creative elements every week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, it had thousands of pieces of content to deploy using artificial intelligence into dynamic templates that combined email, web, and paid channels,\u201d said the BCG report authors.\nLuxury perfume and cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me used this approach as well, with ads built upon a dynamic template and creative assets that were automatically swapped around for improved audience appeal. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand used a continuous feedback loop to update the creative assets based on new customer insights, and these ads ultimately delivered a 31% higher click-through rate compared to static Lanc\u00f4me ads.\nThe dynamic creative were \u201ca great opportunity for our in-house programmatic team to generate actionable consumer insights,\u201d said L\u2019Or\u00e9al Germany\u2019s Head of Precision Marketing Nadine Kamski.\nThis shift toward new creative processes and away from third-party cookies could lead marketers to focus on new metrics to measure their success. While key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates are essential right now, other metrics could become more prevalent in the future. For example, engagement rates, brand lift, and return on investment could become the new standards to measure success.\nThe power of creative marketing is only set to increase, alongside the use of smart automation, as the marketing world transitions to a new privacy-first future.\n\u200b\u200b\u201dThere\u2019s so much to explore on our journey to using data creatively,\u201d says Di Mayze, global head of data at WPP. \u201cCurious data people will drive new kinds of innovation and creativity that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nWhen rethinking your brand\u2019s creative strategy, here are some points to consider."

        "output": "Brands know that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply influence perception. To be ready for what\u2019s next, they need ads to drive action.\nTo explore this, Google partnered with Global Citizen to challenge ten world-class creative and performance agencies with a brief of global importance: mobilize individuals to take action for a better world using direct response ad formats across Google and YouTube.\nWorking together, agencies around the world used Video action campaigns with Discovery ads to inspire action on social challenges across health, inequality, sustainability, and education. The campaigns drove tens of thousands of people around the world to sign up as Global Citizens \u2013 a 220% increase on the average \u2013 resulting in one of Global Citizen\u2019s most successful digital acquisition campaigns, ever.Their journey uncovered 5 takeaways to get brands ready for what\u2019s next.\nTo get viewers to act, make action the center of the concept, versus relying on a call-to-action at the end. Protect the Planet leverages ASMR sound effects, visceral immediacy, and a CTA of \u201cStop this\u201d that progressively reveals throughout the ad to trigger viewer action, which resulted in strong click-through rates. Meanwhile, Advance Equity for All pairs an emotionally driven narrative with a YouTube best practice of breaking the fourth wall to deliver high average watch time and conversions per clickthrough.\nFrom striking visuals to emotional appeals, all campaigns experimented with making action integral to the storyline \u2013 driving record conversions for Global Citizen.\nSrinivas Seshadri, Director, Performance Marketing, Interactive Avenues India (End The Hunger Crisis)\nCombining YouTube and Google ad formats in an action-driving campaign can produce more efficient results than using one ad format alone. Each agency developed incredible action-driven Video action campaigns, but when paired with Discovery ads, the campaigns collectively resulted in 28% lower average conversion costs.Creating for multiple formats doesn't have to be complex. You can simply lift stills from your video asset and use them as images in Discovery ads alongside minimal copy and a succinct CTA. For all campaigns, agencies employed this approach to drive more efficient conversions.\nGeane Mota, Executive Director, Client Solutions, Blinks Essence (End Covid For All)\nGetting your audience\u2019s attention \u2014 and holding on to it \u2014 means you have more opportunity to educate, engage, or inspire. A more informed viewer is more likely to click and convert.\nAdvance Equity for All\u2019s impressive click-to-conversion ratio indicated that the longer audiences watched, the more likely they were to click through. So, grab the viewer's attention, then make sure you use it.\nWhether crafting awareness or action campaigns, the principles of YouTube's ABCD framework and Google Ads best practices remain vital. Attracting attention quickly, integrating brand throughout, and authentically connecting with audiences is essential, no matter the campaign. Once you have the attention of the viewer, be direct. Tell them what you want them to do, and show them how to do it. Campaigns with people-focused creative that address the viewer directly, like End Covid For All, perform well.\nAsking audiences to take action only works once they\u2019re already paying attention. So brands need to make sure they\u2019re making use of best practices in order to make that happen.\nChloe Stephenson, Creative Director, BBH London (Resume Learning)\nThe consumer journey is not linear, meaning that brands and agencies cannot operate in silos of creative and performance. To drive more effective and efficient campaigns, brands must break down these barriers.\nAll creative and performance agencies working on the Global Citizen campaigns partnered from the brief, through creative ideation to execution. Working collaboratively enabled campaign efficiencies and ensured all touchpoints across the customer journey were truly integrated.\nAbi Howson, VP, Video, Jellyfish UK (Resume Learning)\nWhether brands are trying to change the world or drive business results, direct response ad formats on YouTube and Google have the power to share stories that drive real action. Brands that harness the power of data-driven creativity won\u2019t only be ready for what\u2019s next \u2014 they\u2019ll be shaping what next looks like.\nWatch all the campaigns.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio.

        "output": "One of the best parts of working at YouTube is being part of the creator economy and enabling next-generation media companies to make the innovative content people love. Just last week, we announced that over the past three years, YouTube has paid $50 billion to fuel the creator economy. It\u2019s inspiring to see how these entrepreneurs are growing their audiences and businesses, while also experimenting with new tools and formats.\nTake Cassey Ho, for example. You might know her better as Blogilates, the world\u2019s most-watched Pilates instructor, who has made Pilates and wellness accessible to millions of people for more than a decade. During that time, she also became the CEO and lead designer of her own activewear company. And over the past year, she started using YouTube Shorts to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at her design process, and to share fitness tips, quick recipe ideas, and more. She does this all while continuing to post long-form workout videos daily.\nHo\u2019s willingness to innovate and embrace new formats in creative ways makes her beloved by millions. By adapting her content to be multiformat, she\u2019s also demonstrating a deep understanding of how viewers discover and watch videos today.\nThat\u2019s because people now move seamlessly between screens, experiencing worlds of content made of what they love, fueled by creators who are experts in what\u2019s relevant. In fact, streaming across different screens, video lengths, and creators is at an all-time high. Whether the content is long, short, mainstream, or personal, YouTube is the one place where people watch it all.\nHow can brands ensure that they are taking full advantage of a multiformat approach? Here are three key things to do.\nYou\u2019ve seen the dances. You\u2019ve heard the viral audio samples. And you\u2019ve probably been fooled by a \u201ccake or fake?\u201d clip at least once. If video is the breakout medium of the past few years, then mobile short-form vertical video is the breakout format. What\u2019s one thing all those short videos have in common? Creators who are constantly shaping and reacting to trends. Viewers can\u2019t get enough of them.\nSince its launch in 2021, YouTube Shorts is now home to 1.5 billion monthly active users and earns more than 30 billion daily views.1 While it\u2019s a mobile destination, Shorts also fuels discovery across formats and screens. Creators who upload both long-form video and Shorts on YouTube see longer overall watch time and subscriber growth. According to YouTube\u2019s latest Culture & Trends Report, 59% of Gen Z \u2014 the world\u2019s largest generation \u2014 agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nWhile viewers favor their mobile devices for short-form vertical video, they\u2019re increasingly turning to another familiar place for long-form online video from their favorite creators. In fact, TV is YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing screen today, with watch time continuing to level up. As of January 2022, on average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.3 The growing popularity of connected devices tells us that the old distinctions between network TV, digital, streaming, and mobile video are fading.\nSome of the shortest videos on YouTube last only a second or two, whereas the longest video on YouTube right now would take you about eight days to watch. Seriously. So what\u2019s the perfect length and type of content to keep viewers engaged?\nWe\u2019ve spent years studying and refining best practices for effective storytelling via short-form and long-form content on YouTube, exploring what makes content \u201cgood,\u201d and defining the ABCDs of effective YouTube creative. We also look to creators. Since the earliest days of video sharing on the internet, they\u2019ve experimented and optimized the length of their videos to find the sweet spot of audience attention. Because of this, they\u2019re a strong indicator of what works on YouTube.\nRight now, creators of all popularity levels are using short-form video as the latest space to experiment with new approaches and engage viewers. South Korean girl band Blackpink, for example, created the #PinkVenomChallenge on Shorts to promote the release of their latest music video, \u201cPink Venom.\u201d The group\u2019s multiformat marketing approach helped them set a new YouTube record: Pink Venom garnered 90.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the third-biggest 24-hour music video debut of all time.\nOther creators like fitness instructor GrowWithJo and dermatologist Dr. Dray have discovered that Shorts help them expand their existing YouTube channel audience and balance out their long-form content. GrowWithJo shares quick workout tips and tutorials on Shorts, inspiring viewers to also check out her long-form exercise videos. Meanwhile, Dr. Dray complements her in-depth skin care content with Shorts that offer bite-sized advice, such as quick answers to questions like \u201cWhat age to start retinoid?\u201d\nAnother way creators experiment is by giving their Shorts a distinctive style that stands out from other video formats. They might use built-in effects and filters, try different editing styles, or add popular audio samples. On top of this, they tend to use short-form video to capture content that\u2019s emotional in nature, whether delivering joy, high drama, or laughter.\nAll of this experimentation with short-form video makes creators an excellent resource for actionable Shorts-related tips. We often look to creators\u2019 learnings and insights when developing tools, templates, and creative best practices for making vertical video ads on YouTube. Here are some of our favorite creator tips for building successful Shorts.\nAs brands take inspiration from creators and experiment with short-form vertical video, they should keep in mind other creative considerations and the availability of automated tools and templates that make video ad creation easy.\nTo take advantage of this new evolution in content and user experience, marketers should think more expansively about their video campaigns and build for a range of ad lengths and screens. They can use this opportunity to break from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video ads by, instead, adapting creative assets to the look and vibe of the ad environment, whether it\u2019s in-depth, long-form video or casual, short vertical videos.\nThis combination of video ad formats is a recipe for success on YouTube. After all, adding vertical video to the mix gives brands a new creative canvas to tell their story and expand their multiformat strategy on YouTube, which helps drive the results they care about. Plus, Shorts can help brands show up alongside culturally relevant, creator-driven content that viewers love.\nMarketers should also use Shorts as a new way to achieve lower-funnel campaign goals. Because YouTube is a source of inspiration along the shopping journey, short-form video can easily help turn viewers into customers. And brands can now add vertical video assets to Video action, App, and Performance Max campaigns, which automatically scale to Shorts. Early testing shows that adding a vertical video asset to Video action campaigns delivers 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts compared to landscape videos alone.4\nCreators have been at the forefront of multiformat content experimentation, and have seen their YouTube presence and viewership grow exponentially as a result. Marketers can find similar success by studying how people move from screen to screen to watch different video formats, following creators\u2019 tips on how to engage audiences with Shorts, and using multiformat content to drive results across the entire funnel."

        "output": "Elizaveta Orekhovskaya and Artem Ryzhenkov, video advertising managers at global SaaS company Semrush, share the step-by-step plan behind their company\u2019s initiative to increase conversions with no additional budget.\nAt this stage of the pandemic, everyone is familiar with the laundry list of challenges faced by companies around the world: nervous customers, employee churn, supply-chain bottlenecks, and so on. Like the COVID-19 variants themselves, these challenges continue to take new forms with sometimes uncertain consequences.\nIn 2022, with many small- to mid-sized brands embracing digital advertising strategies for the first time, one key challenge is to break through the noise created by this shift in consumer behaviors and subsequent marketing activity.\nAt Semrush, where our business is to help brands manage their visibility on the internet, we faced this very problem as we set out to promote our own niche product with a complex funnel.\nOur customers use the Semrush platform to optimize search engine results and market more effectively online. Our platform simplifies content creation, social media, campaign creation, and competitive intelligence. Our primary goal with our most recent digital marketing initiative was to increase conversions with no additional budget. Here\u2019s how we did it.\nWe started out by investing in search and display traffic. Using keyword-based targeting, we identified an audience of users who were in-market for our product and began \u201cwarming up\u201d these potential customers with display visuals.\nThen we sought new media environments where we could drive performance without going over budget. We chose YouTube as one of these channels, given video\u2019s proven ability to create a story about a product. Our marketing team had tried YouTube before, but as we will see in a moment, its results left something to be desired.\nInitially, we set up our YouTube campaigns manually, rather than automating them. We did this mostly to understand the available optimization metrics. We launched a number of videos and analyzed them based on cost per impression, cost per view, cost per click, and click-through rate. With this knowledge in hand, our team began automating campaigns using performance metrics, such as cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate.\nThe next step was to develop a system for conversion and attribution tracking. Whereas we had previously attributed most ad conversions based on the click alone, we now added view-based attribution of YouTube ads using Google Campaign Manager.\nWith this change, YouTube\u2019s provable value as an ad channel \u2014 particularly at the customer attraction stage \u2014 was far more clear. And these placements assumed privilege of place among our other paid channels.\nOur team then tested every possible audience type, ad format, and bidding strategy. We found that custom audiences worked better for promoting a specific product than it did for a generic brand. In cases with frequently fluctuating budgets and long conversion funnels, a Maximize conversion bidding strategy proved more effective than a Target CPA strategy. And we settled on the skippable in-stream ad as the most effective ad format for its product.\nOnce the preliminary results were available, we set out to optimize our ad creatives and landing pages.\nOlga Denisova, our VP for digital marketing, observed that a better conversion rate at each stage is achieved by having videos of a certain duration, type of content, degree of complexity, and format \u2014 that is, animated or with human actors.\nFor example, at the upper stages of the funnel, we used short videos of up to 15 seconds that featured the product and encouraged trials. For lower-funnel marketing, we presented lengthier videos \u2014 up to a minute long \u2014 with more detail about a specific product feature or customer success story.\nBased on this insight, Denisova and her team began optimizing our video creatives according to the audience\u2019s phase of purchase consideration.\nOur earlier video creatives had basic graphics with lots of text but lacked voice-over and dynamism.\nWe corrected this in newer videos, focusing on more striking visuals with human actors. The CTA was also reworked for different stages of the funnel, and the video duration was optimized.\nOnce we had worked out our optimal YouTube ads settings, we set out to scale up the Semrush channel.\nBased on past experience, we introduced an optimal frequency of seven impressions per day and 10 views per month.\nFor remarketing campaigns, we based our learning strategy on the size of the targeted audience. In the upper remarketing funnel, with its large available audience of website visitors and registered users, we deployed Google\u2019s Maximize conversions bidding strategy. The lower stages of the funnel were optimized for cost per view, since the smaller available audience meant machine-learning strategies were less powerful.\nIt became clear over the course of this campaign that YouTube advertising not only delivered conversions directly, but also contributed to an increase in paid and organic search results. We saw interest in Semrush in the U.S. grow by an average of 72.6% during a Brand Lift study conducted in May 2021, while interest in our Keyword Magic Tool grew by 120.4%. Another video ad campaign in Canada delivered an increase in paid and organic Google search results of 521%.\nSince the pandemic restricted our ability to produce new video assets, we needed to improve our conversion metrics without increasing our budget or the number of video creatives we produced. To achieve this, our team used a new format from Google called Video Action campaigns, designed to drive lower funnel actions such as website clicks and conversions. As a result, the range of our ads expanded, their variability increased, and automated strategies began learning better from the increased number of conversions.\nIn Video Action campaign ads, we found the ideal palette for our new ad creatives. In one A/B test, a combination of skippable in-stream ads and Video Action campaign ads went up against skippable in-stream ads only. The combined strategy clearly performed better.\nOur CPA at the lowest stage of the funnel was 55% lower than that of the in-stream-only campaign. The cost per sign-up also fell 51%. Video Action campaigns cost 91% less, and view-through rates were 3% higher, than in-stream.\nAfter Video Action proved itself to be the superior strategy, not only on the basis of conversion but also in upper-funnel metrics, we launched the format in all automated strategy campaigns. This helped reduce the CPA per purchase from YouTube ads by a whopping 11%."

        "output": "The earliest known car ad told Scientific American readers that its product was a better investment than a horse. Today\u2019s auto brands face a crowded and competitive landscape, demanding more inventiveness. Producing an ad that really connects with the viewer can be a challenge. Creative is one tool you can leverage to make significant differences in ROI, and experimenting makes it easy to adapt and update campaigns at scale.\nTo find out what makes auto ads effective, our team analyzed thousands of auto ads on YouTube to better understand what drove performance. Based on our findings, we determined that these five creative strategies set the most successful ads apart.\nWhen it comes to the first few seconds of an auto ad, put the pedal to the metal. Opt for dropping viewers right into the action to hook their attention, over the more traditional wide running car footage they\u2019re used to seeing. From there, introduce dynamism with quickly paced, contrasting visuals paired with audio and supers.\nThe Cupra Born spot kicks off with a flash of a speeding car and keeps the momentum going by interspersing clips of the car with fleeting shots of engaging visuals to evoke the energy and excitement of being behind the wheel. The fast pace and rapid-fire stimuli grip the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them engaged throughout the ad.\nFacts and specs are important, but they\u2019re not the only things that work to sell a car. Anchoring your story in human experience allows your audience to imagine the tangible experience of the car, and how it might fit into their lives, building a personal, and more powerful, connection to your brand.\nMitsubishi Brazil\u2019s New Generation spot features women from all backgrounds literally and figuratively taking the wheel, including the wheel of a powerful new four-wheel drive. Multiple characters and a powerful storyline give viewers a reason to connect and emotionally invest.\nEngines revving, brakes squealing, tires hitting the ground: These familiar sounds create an immersive experience for viewers, an experience that becomes critical on YouTube, where 95% of ads are played with the sound on.1 Sound effects, voice-over, and other audio elements have been shown to engage people\u2019s attention and help them imagine what it\u2019s like to drive a particular car \u2014 an important consideration for purchase.\nMini USA\u2019s Hardtop 2-Door Hatchback spot amplifies the sound of the engine throughout the ad alongside everyday dialogue and a fun music track, bringing the full driving experience to life in an immersive and relatable way.\nEvery spot is a chance to show off the specs and features that make your car stand out from the rest, and simplicity is key. Ads shorter than 15 seconds are better served by focusing on one or two things, whereas longer ads have more wiggle room. The key is to keep it clear and not force too many messages at once. Have a lot to say? Consider experimenting by breaking up your multifeature spot with several shorter single-feature ads.\nFord US\u2019s F-150 campaign highlights two key features centered around one idea: making work accessible and easy, both inside and out, when you\u2019re on the road. The message is clear and simple, giving these standout features their chance to shine.\nMore than 70% of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices globally,2 so making your ad viewable on a 5-inch screen is a minimum requirement. Think bright, high-contrast colors, tight framing, and large-type supers to make your ad stand out on that small screen. \u201cBut will that translate to TV?\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve seen that mobile-first ads work just as well on connected TVs.3\nVolkswagen Canada uses bright colors and tight shots of their cars paired with large-type supers that add playful taglines to their fleet of SUVWs, ensuring that the ad is not only eye-catching, but memorable.\nUse these five data-backed creative strategies as a starting point for your next auto ad. Each tactic leaves plenty of room for your brand\u2019s unique sensibility. And once you have a strong foundation, try experimenting with different iterations of your creative to see what works best for your specific audience."

        "output": "Each year, the YouTube Works Awards program partners with Kantar to celebrate the most innovative and effective YouTube advertising in the industry. 2021 presented unique creative challenges as marketers faced the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, digital privacy concerns, and new privacy regulations. Undeterred, the brands with the six winning campaigns produced fresh, groundbreaking ideas that masterfully combined creative storytelling and YouTube. \u201cIn years past, there have been some category winners that were just brilliant video. When I look across this year\u2019s winners, everyone innovated and used the platform,\u201d said judge Colleen Leddy, chief engagement officer at Droga5.\nLet\u2019s look at four major takeaways from our winning campaigns and how they ingeniously used YouTube to drive impressive business results.\nBLK, a dating app for Gen Z and young millennials in the Black community, wanted its users to go from online connections to safe, real-life interactions. However, the COVID-19 health crisis still loomed and the COVID-19 vaccine remained a point of contention in the Black community. BLK decided to tap into Gen Z and young millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for streaming music to encourage its audience to get the vaccine. The brand launched a music video on YouTube called \u201cVax That Thang Up,\u201d which was inspired by a classic hip-hop song.\nThough the video stood at roughly two minutes in length and could be skipped, it still received over 3 billion media impressions in the first day. New registrations on the BLK app increased by 30% week over week, and first-time paid subscribers grew by 22% week over week. \u201cThey leveraged skippable and made you engaged enough to not want to skip,\u201d marveled one of our judges.\nIn contrast to BLK\u2019s longer content, travel metasearch site Kayak used quick, 15-seconds-or-less videos to address the effects of COVID-19 on travel. Using its own research and Google Trends, Kayak discovered that, even though many travel restrictions were still in place, Americans actually wanted to travel but needed the reassurance of more flexibility and options when booking trips. In response, Kayak created multiple campaigns that highlighted free cancellation and encouraged viewers to \u201cskip town\u201d instead of hitting the \u201cskip ad\u201d button.\nThe campaign proved a huge success, driving incremental conversion rates as high as 7.5% and raising purchase intent by 20%. John Deschner from Maximum Effort was impressed: \u201cThey helped you get over travel hesitancy in different ways and targeted people that were searching for these things.\u201d\nBlendJet, a blender company with a mission to make healthy food fast, easily appealed to women 24 to 54 years old, but knew it could reach a wider audience. For the launch of its new blender, the brand created a fun, out-of-the-ordinary campaign, which tapped into two wildly popular YouTube trends: \u201coddly satisfying videos\u201d and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). BlendJet\u2019s campaign, called \u201cOddly Satisfying ASMR Blends in a BlendJet 2 Portable Blender,\u201d featured a voice-over whispering clever statements while the blender hypnotically pulverized entire heads of cauliflower, chunks of ice, and more. To make sure this campaign would be seen by people most likely to buy its blenders, BlendJet focused on a custom intent audience segment, using its top converting keywords in Google Search.\nViewers ate it up. The video became a viral sensation that generated millions of dollars in sales. As a result, BlendJet\u2019s return on ad spend grew 569% year over year, and its revenue surpassed its initial target by 413%. Amanda Richman, CEO of Mindshare, praised BlendJet for turning a product demo into \u201csomething so different through the voice-over, the copy. They created content that is spot on for YouTube viewing.\u201d\nNew to the U.S. market, cat food brand Sheba needed an impactful campaign that would resonate with American cat parents. During its research, the brand discovered that cats often woke up their owners at unreasonable hours, like at four in the morning. Google Search data and YouTube analytics showed Sheba that roughly 1 in 3 people turned to their mobile phones during these moments. So Sheba created a soothing, five-hour video that used scientifically proven techniques to get people back to sleep. To promote the video during the day, Sheba released \u201csubliminal\u201d bumper ads. At night, it launched TrueView for action ads that were tailored to people\u2019s middle-of-the-night viewing habits on YouTube. A simple call to action in the ads would then lead tired cat parents to Sheba\u2019s sleep video.\nThe campaign resulted in a 100.9% uplift in brand recall and a 635% increase in searches for Sheba brand terms among those who had been exposed to the campaign. \u201cIt really was the best use of creative and media that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Traci Spiegelman, VP of global media at Mastercard. \u201cWhen you have a good insight, and find the right creative and media approach, you nail it.\u201d\nOnline dating app Tinder wanted to help the bisexual and bi+ community get more recognition and own the narrative around what it means to be bi+. It launched \u201cOnce Upon a Bi,\u201d a campaign that featured YouTube Creators reimagining well-known fairy tales based on the bi+ community\u2019s experience within the Tinder app. The brand then used TrueView for action to focus the campaign on affinity audience categories that overlapped with the creators\u2019 audiences.\nThe campaign received 3.2 million impressions, 2 million video views, and an average view rate that was 9% stronger than Tinder\u2019s previous campaign. \u201cTaking stories that have been passed on for generations and showing how they reinforce stereotypes, and using influencers and creators to tell the story was a really good use of YouTube,\u201d said Sheryl Goldstein, EVP, chief industry growth officer at IAB.\nDepartment store Target also partnered with a YouTube Creator to help diverse communities share their own stories. \u201cConvos with CEOs,\u201d a video series moderated by creator Hallease, centered on the entrepreneurial journeys of the Black-owned business founders whose products are in Target stores. Along with using paid media, Target promoted the campaign organically on YouTube by posting customer teaser content on its brand channel and publishing a playlist for the series.\nThe campaign garnered over 6.4 million views across all of the videos, over 107,000 hours of watch time, and over 20,000 total engagements on YouTube. \u201cThose convos were really rich and did the job that an ad could not have done,\u201d said Britt Nolan, president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett.\nIn a tough year, YouTube Works Awards winners turned hurdles into inspiration, reimagined content people already loved, appealed to their audiences 24/7, and gave the stage to diverse communities. They proved that a winning combination of clever storytelling and the YouTube platform can produce both viral sensations and enviable business results."

        "output": "Amy Lanzi is the North American practice lead at Publicis Commerce, overseeing product and talent development, and connecting commerce practitioners from across the Publicis network to enable client-centric solutions. Here she explains how YouTube factors into consumers\u2019 shopping journeys.\nThe other day, my hair dryer broke.\nRather than immediately go to the store to buy a replacement, I decided to go online. I started with a simple YouTube search: \u201chow to blow dry long hair.\u201d But an interesting thing happened on my journey across the internet. I found new, related products I didn\u2019t even know existed. And, what do you know, instead of just buying a hair dryer, I bought the whole suite of products.\nFinding surprising products in a brick-and-mortar store is, or used to be, a common experience: that magical shopping moment when you stumble across something new that fits your needs perfectly. But this time, it happened in the world\u2019s biggest video storefront: YouTube.\nThe idea that e-commerce would evolve 10 years in six months started spreading during the pandemic. And while variations circulated around the industry, the concept is proving to be true: In 2020 alone, e-commerce grew nearly 30% worldwide.1\nThis summer, Publicis Groupe partnered with YouTube and Talk Shoppe to understand how the shopping journey has changed, and how brands can help enhance and expand people\u2019s experiences online. Here\u2019s what we found.\nSeventy-five percent of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration.2 This is because people have a shopping discovery mindset when they\u2019re watching video \u2014 and, of course, because there\u2019s so much content out there for them to discover.\nDue to the personalized experience of YouTube, they\u2019re not finding noise, but things that make their experiences and their lives better. For example, average daily uploads of videos with \u201cShop With Me\u201d in the title increased by over 60%, year over year.3\nYouTube is the matchmaker shoppers and brands have always wanted. You never know when a new shopping journey will begin. Importantly, this inspiration results in bigger shopping carts and upsells. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they can make a decision to purchase or not purchase faster.4\nCreators are the heart and soul of YouTube and the most tailored, personalized, shopping confidant someone could have. They are hybrids of a personal assistant and best friend, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.5\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 2021.\nWhen quality information is paired with authenticity, shoppers make confident decisions quicker, instead of leaving items in their cart while they weigh their options.\nMy daughter got me hooked on Emma Chamberlain. Twice, recently, we purchased something after watching her content. Social proof is powerful, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give them the best information about products and brands.6\nOf course, not everyone follows YouTube creators, but they can still find help on YouTube along their shopping journey. For these people, creator content is incredibly valuable, because the breadth, depth, and searchability means shoppers can find high-quality information. It\u2019s similar to reviews or star ratings on marketplaces. YouTube is a one-stop shop for the curious consumer.\nFor example, thrifting haul videos, a subset of the ever-popular haul format, in which creators share purchases that they\u2019ve made, have been viewed over 100 million times.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that YouTube\u2019s appeal as a shopping platform comes in exactly the place where brands can sometimes feel uncomfortable: It\u2019s all creator-driven, vast, and not always easy to wrap our minds around.\nResearch has repeatedly shown us that the quality of information matters more to shoppers than production quality. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they get the highest quality information about products.7\nWhen I think about these insights, I see opportunities everywhere: opportunities for brands to grow through partnering with creators; opportunities for platforms like YouTube to evolve and meet shopper needs; and opportunities to connect in new ways.\nOnline shopping is a whole new ballgame. And brands and advertisers need to adapt in this new world if they want to win big."

        "output": "As marketers, we share a common goal: Convince people to engage with our brands. Truth be told, it can take a lot of work to make this happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always struck by YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard, an annual list of the most-watched video ads of the year. In a world of unlimited content, millions of people actually choose to watch these ads, so it\u2019s useful to consider what makes them so successful.\nWhile no single formula exists for a viral video ad, we can make observations about what works to inspire our own media strategies. Here are three proven approaches to try, pulled from the latest Ads Leaderboard.\nFor its \u201cHarry Potter\u201d 20th anniversary special, HBO Max wanted to reach two distinct audiences: die-hard \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans eager to be reintroduced to the magic of the series and a new generation of younger viewers who hadn\u2019t yet embraced the franchise.\nTo appeal to both groups, HBO Max leaned into a powerful trend: people like watching content that makes them feel nostalgic. With that trend in mind, the brand designed a video ad to give viewers a heartwarming, retrospective experience full of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d memories. Beyond showcasing the cast\u2019s memorable moments, the ad pulled in fans and authentically celebrated their journey too.\nHBO Max used YouTube to power the campaign. As JP Mallo, VP of marketing for HBO Max Originals, explains, \u201cYouTube is often our initial indicator when we release early marketing assets for how our audience is engaging, what sentiments we\u2019re seeing, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re responding to in terms of content themes.\u201d\nYouTube proved to be an ideal home for HBO Max\u2019s ads, since people of all ages gravitate to the platform for nostalgic content. According to a 2022 Ipsos survey, 80% of Gen Z reported watching YouTube to feel nostalgic;1 by running a nostalgia-based campaign on YouTube, HBO Max could appeal to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d enthusiasts, while also grabbing the attention of a younger generation.\nThe campaign launched mid-November with bumper ads, plus non-skippable and skippable in-stream ads to drive awareness and consideration. Then, in the days leading up to the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, HBO Max used YouTube Select to feature the ads alongside premium content. Finally, they concluded the campaign by leveraging YouTube Masthead before and after the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, placing the video on YouTube\u2019s home feed to drive mass awareness. In the end, the approach drove 12.7% awareness lift \u2014 remarkable for a brand with high awareness already \u2014 and reached 49 million unique users.\nWE, Egypt\u2019s primary telecommunications company, needed an ad campaign that could cut through the holiday noise during the busy Ramadan season. To achieve this, it strategized videos that would help viewers understand evolving trends of Ramadan.\nSince WE\u2019s message had to appeal to viewers across multiple generations, the team determined that \u201cthe campaign should include a diverse mix of ads,\u201d says Eslam Nassar, the brand\u2019s head of digital marketing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we turned to YouTube to tell a compelling, creative story across ad formats and screens.\u201d\nWE planned and executed a full-funnel video strategy that leveraged a unique blend of short- and long-form ads. For viewers in the awareness phase, the team launched 6-second bumper ads to tease the campaign and deliver a quick call to action.\nThen, to further engage middle- and lower-funnel audiences, WE created a full-length, in-stream video. This ad was designed to be watched across devices, from connected TV to mobile. To ensure that this long-form ad could fully immerse people in the brand\u2019s unique approach to storytelling, the team relied on YouTube\u2019s four guiding principles for effective video ads on the platform, the ABCDs \u2014 shorthand for attention, branding, connection and direction.\nTo quickly gain the attention of and connect with viewers, the video began with a catchy musical track. WE made sure the distinctive purple color of its logo dominated the video\u2019s visuals to reinforce company branding. To further connect with multigenerational viewers, the video compared and contrasted Ramadan traditions throughout the ages. Finally, the video directed people to take action by signing up for WE\u2019s services so they could stay in touch with family.\nThis multiformat strategy proved successful. Within the first 24 hours, the long-form video exceeded 1 million views. What\u2019s more, its completion rate surpassed the brand\u2019s 2021 Ramadan video by 204% as well as the market average for completion rate by 47%. Ultimately, the campaign reached 79% of Egypt\u2019s YouTube population.\nWE\u2019s digital advertising manager, Ahmed Nageb, concludes, \u201cYouTube is one of most important platforms to help us execute our digital strategies effectively. Because of its vast audience, which can be targeted through various ad formats and devices, we were able to achieve maximum reach, while hitting our campaign objectives.\u201d\nLast year, BMW launched its first ever fully electric BMW iX sports activity vehicle in the United States. To promote this milestone during the Super Bowl, BMW created a 60-second hero video ad that showed Zeus, the mythical Greek god of sky and thunder, retiring to Palm Springs and rediscovering his spark when gifted a BMW iX by his wife, Hera.\nTo extend the ad\u2019s reach during this tentpole moment, BMW made YouTube a core part of its Super Bowl strategy. \u201cYouTube is a great amplifier of content, which not only increased the audience size exponentially but extended the longevity of the spot,\u201d explains Albrecht Pagenstert, head of brand marketing at BMW. \u201cWhat ran once during the Super Bowl lives online and has received millions of additional views.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s strategy hinged on reaching a wide variety of passionate Super Bowl fans through YouTube AdBlitz, the premier hub for fans to watch Super Bowl ads with playlists for the most comedic, dramatic, action-packed, and inspirational spots. Through AdBlitz, BMW could target specific Super Bowl-related video inventory, such as NFL Highlights watched by sports lovers, and Big Game Music Lineups watched by audiophiles.\nOnce the campaign peaked viewers\u2019 interest during YouTube AdBlitz, BMW then strategized to satisfy their hunger for more content. It released behind-the-scenes videos, including interviews with the hero ad\u2019s star-studded cast and director.\nAudiences couldn\u2019t get enough of BMW\u2019s campaign. In fact, many YouTube commenters enthusiastically asked for the hero video to be turned into a full movie. In the end, the video drove 17 million unique views and 970,000 clicks. In addition to being recognized on YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard in the U.S., BMW earned the No. 7 spot in USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter.\nHBO Max, WE, and BMW struck gold with video ads that entertained and engaged key audiences. By aligning their ads with popular YouTube trends, building bespoke creative for different platforms, and following the ABCDs of video effectiveness, these brands showed how to successfully combine immersive storytelling with the power of YouTube."

        "input": "",
        "output": "It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in the middle of a digital video boom, as alternatives to linear TV grow at unprecedented rates. According to Nielsen\u2019s total TV and streaming report, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time.1 And viewers watch a daily average of over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV devices.2\nSource: YouTube Internal Data, Global, Jan. 2022.\nThis level of engagement informs how viewers feel about ads. In a new study, we found that viewers agree that YouTube ads on the TV screen are more relevant (59%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3 Connected TV gives advertisers a powerful creative canvas to reach viewers when they are highly engaged, streaming their favorite content on the living room screen.\nTo better understand the opportunity for advertisers, these three brands ran experiments to see how effective CTV could be for their audiences. Here are the questions they set out to answer.\nOn behalf of its Ruffles brand, Frito-Lay North America leveraged CTV to engage with some of its core audiences, such as younger families, flavor variety seekers, millennials, and those living in urban areas. The marketing team wanted to understand how increases in watch time on CTV contributed to brand and sales goals.\nIn 2021, Ruffles ran an A/B test with half the media budget delivered across devices as usual and the other half with an increased allocation to CTV. It then compared performance to delivery.\nThe result? \u201cThe higher delivery to the increased CTV cells exceeded our expectations and benchmarks across view rates, ad recall, and sales lift,\u201d said Amanda Corral, senior director of paid media strategy at Frito-Lay North America. \u201cAnd we achieved this without sacrificing CPM or reach. We were thrilled to deliver a strong impact while maintaining efficiency and delivering higher ROI.\u201d\nL\u2019Oreal USA has built its brands with a commitment to consumer-centricity. Across its brands, that has meant committing to cut-through creative. (Think, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re born with it, maybe it\u2019s \u2026 .\u201d You know the rest.) It has also meant constantly refining media and audience strategies that evolve as the brands\u2019 customers do. For the past several years, L\u2019Oreal USA has followed the lead of its customers and ramped up investment in YouTube.\nThe company has honed a tried-and-true approach to creative and reach, and wanted to see how that approach scaled to CTV. So in the summer of 2021, when it was time to lean into upper-format, demand-generating media, L\u2019Oreal USA increased its YouTube investment by 102% year over year. \u201cWhat was interesting about this time was, we were seeing audience behavior patterns around ad-supported streaming and a boom in CTV that we knew wasn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d said Shenan Reed, SVP, head of media at L\u2019Oreal USA.\nThe company ran a meta-analysis across nearly 30 NCS sales lift studies and found that its YouTube activity delivered an average of 6% sales lift for its campaigns. The company also saw a 6 to 1 return on ad spend on YouTube CTV screens. Not only did this prove that L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s creative and audience strategies can scale to CTV, but it also saw that the majority of impact was coming from new consumers. That\u2019s important because, coming out of the pandemic, the team knew the company needed to attract the next generation of new consumers and first-time buyers.\n\u201cOur consumer is still in the living room, but they\u2019re watching a wider variety of content \u2014 content that is more personal, that\u2019s more of the moment. You can ignore that behavior, or you can choose to show up. And we chose to show up,\u201d said Reed.\nDocuSign was initially apprehensive about CTV, since users aren\u2019t able to click through and convert on the TV screen. However, the brand put aside those reservations and decided to experiment by using the channel to increase reach and brand awareness. DocuSign understood the importance of reaching its users wherever they were, including their connected TVs.\n\u201cBefore this test, we didn\u2019t know there was such a large audience on CTV that we weren\u2019t reaching through other video ads,\u201d said Andy Tack, senior marketing manager at DocuSign.\nBy running a CTV-dedicated advertising campaign alongside a regular cross-device campaign, DocuSign was able to isolate and quantify the impact CTV had on its campaigns. The marketing team found that the CTV ads drove a best-in-class 33% relative lift in ad recall. Furthermore, despite worries about barriers to action, DocuSign actually saw a 126% relative conversion lift for its trial sign-ups.\n\u201cWe can now clearly see the value CTV has in our campaigns,\u201d said Tack. \u201cWhether we\u2019re growing brand awareness and recall, or improving consideration and purchase intent, CTV is a critical part of our approach.\u201d\nNo model exists for the perfect CTV advertising strategy. Whether planning media on behalf of a CPG company, reaching new cosmetics buyers, or taking a chance on a new channel, brands of all types are showing what can be done. The one thing they have in common is that their efforts were rewarded."

        "output": "In today\u2019s uncertain economy, video marketers may find it difficult to keep calm and carry on. For most, measuring the effectiveness of their media investments will be a top priority. And while focusing on measurement can help marketers fuel both short-term and long-term growth, not all measurement approaches are created equal. Success depends on having the right media strategies and tools.\nIt may be tempting, for instance, to concentrate only on immediate results during disruptive times. But savvy marketers will combine their short-term and long-term business goals and take a more holistic full-funnel approach to YouTube. Indeed, recent research by Nielsen shows that brands that added upper-funnel marketing efforts to existing mid-funnel campaigns were able to boost return on investment (ROI) by 70%. And brands that added upper-funnel tactics to campaigns that covered the middle and lower funnels were able to raise ROI by 13%.\nProving the value of a full-funnel video strategy requires using measurement tools and tactics that leverage how upper-funnel brand goals and lower-funnel performance objectives play off each other. To do this successfully, marketers can use an effective three-part framework that balances tried-and-new methods with newly emerging measurement practices. Two parts of the framework \u2014 attribution and incrementality \u2014 help set you up for short-term business outcomes, while the third part \u2014 marketing mix modeling \u2014 can help you make smarter decisions for the long haul.\nHere is a deeper look at how to apply the framework.\nThese days, using an attribution model that assigns credit for conversions to different ads that occur across the customer journey should be standard practice. When it\u2019s done right, attribution can help marketers easily optimize their ad strategies. Google\u2019s data-driven attribution model can help you analyze your customers\u2019 journey across Search, YouTube, and Display to discover which touchpoints are most effective.\nWhile attribution can help you uncover and optimize for opportunities quickly, it\u2019s important not to treat it as a stand-alone measurement solution. Relying only on attribution insights to optimize your plans may provide quick growth, but it will come at the risk of not investing in the upper-funnel branding strategies that constantly refuel the pool of customer demand. Additionally, as measurement becomes more challenging in a privacy-first world, having multiple sources of truth instead of relying solely on attribution will be critical. To take attribution to the next level, pair it with incrementality.\nOne powerful way to supplement attribution and take your measurement mix to the next level is to include incrementality. Generally defined as a lift or increase in a desired outcome, incrementality helps you understand the KPI uplift due to your ad. As a result, incrementality can help you better understand the impact of full-funnel campaigns and pave the way for longer term growth.\nThe primary way to measure incrementality is to measure the performance of your full-funnel video strategy using various lift metrics. Google offers an array of solutions to measure lift across the customer journey, including Brand Lift , Search Lift, and Conversion Lift. When combined into one unified view of measurement, Google uses these metrics to showcase the value and impact of YouTube full-funnel campaigns that span all marketing objectives to help you understand the effectiveness of each.\nIncrementality should never be treated as a one-off exercise, regardless of the outcome. Embracing a test-and-learn mindset will better position brands for resilience and long-term growth. Harvard Business Review found that marketers who run multiple tests see up to 30% higher ad performance. Once you have results in hand, optimize your media accordingly. Keep in mind that it\u2019s critical to continue gathering insights and refining your strategy beyond your initial tests. Building experimentation into your overall measurement plan will help ensure that you are consistently optimizing and refining over time.\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is a tried-and-true, privacy-durable way to measure the impact of all YouTube formats across the funnel. It is also an effective way to capture both the short- and long-term impact of marketing investments. Using longitudinal online and offline data, MMMs provide you with the ROI for each media channel. Not only should these studies be used to show how media channels performed in the past, they should be used to optimize your media allocations moving forward.\nResults from MMM studies take into account a combination of variables, so it\u2019s critical to break out YouTube from other video platforms where possible. A Nielsen study found that the return on ad spend from marketing mix models varied by as much as 48% when video platforms were individualized versus when they were aggregated together. And format-level insights provide the most actionable level of granularity, especially when it comes to a full-funnel mix. Inputs matter when it comes to your model.\nEconomic uncertainty can rattle even the most confident marketer. But adopting a full-funnel video media strategy and balancing complementary short-term and long-term measurement practices can help fuel long-term business growth. To ensure the value and effectiveness of your full-funnel strategy, marketers should leverage attribution, incrementality, continuous experimentation, and MMM to drive short-term performance and reach your overarching branding goals."

        "output": "Marie Gulin-Merle, global VP of ads marketing at Google, speaks at a round-table discussion about the AI revolution during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about a meeting I had more than a decade ago, when digital marketing was at the beginning of its mobile revolution. A consulting company was advising me to embrace \u201creal-time\u201d marketing. I was intrigued, but didn\u2019t think it was attainable given the state of the technology we had at that time.\nI was spending my days in the trenches with my teams and agencies. We wrestled with how to create assets across an ever-multiplying set of formats. We scrambled to keep up with trends that would ignite like wildfire, only to dissipate just as quickly. We were manually piecing together the right media mix and trying to figure out how to spend budgets in a way that delivered ROI.\nMore than anything, I dreamed of being able to get out of the weeds of digital execution to focus my attention on our customer connections, the quality of our storytelling, and our business outcomes. I just wanted to get back to marketing. But, at the time, that felt like science fiction.\nNot anymore.\nWe\u2019re all already using AI to reach our customers more efficiently. In fact, 80% of Google\u2019s customers are already using AI-powered Search ads products. Now with generative AI, marketers have a rapidly expanding set of AI-powered tools with the potential to revolutionize every single part of marketing \u2014 from how we mine for insights, brainstorm ideas, and generate content to how we connect with people, drive growth, and measure performance.\nWhen it comes to content, my biggest pain point as a marketer is simple. There are never enough people to keep up with the velocity, volume, and variations required to reach people when and where I need to.\nNow, with new AI-powered tools, my team can scale the creative concepts we love to more formats with unprecedented precision. This means more time and attention can be devoted to shaping core creative concepts. AI can then draw from this source material to instantaneously generate assets like social copy, landing pages, and emails.\nAI can do the same for ads, with alternate ad copy, automatically formatted videos, and multiple combinations of product photos, all leading to infinite permutations of tailored ads for every customer.\nAt Google we\u2019ve been using AI in our ad products since 2015. And we\u2019re already allocating a significant amount of our media spend toward AI-generated creative across Display, Video, and Search, because it has proved to be effective. There are three core areas we\u2019re focused on.\nCreative testing: Google Cloud technology is helping us use AI to score creative, predicting success or failure, before we put it out into the world. In ongoing pilots, we\u2019re using AI to help us weed out poor performers more quickly and to more easily identify potential winners. We\u2019re also working with an agency partner to apply AI to our creative asset library. That way we can understand what has performed well historically and use that knowledge to develop future campaigns.\nCampaign optimization: Our marketing teams do all of their on-stack optimization with AI. Our teams are using AI to identify the best mix of formats and placements to meet our goals across screens and audiences. Although people\u2019s behaviors are complex, reaching them across multiple surfaces \u2014 YouTube, Search, Gmail, Maps, Shopping, and Discover \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be. For example, Performance Max, our AI-powered campaign type, is driving an 18% uplift in conversions at a similar cost per action.1\nMeasurement: In response to people\u2019s increasing expectations for digital privacy, regulators and tech platforms are restricting techniques that advertisers have relied on for decades to reach audiences and measure results, such as device IDs and third-party cookies. We\u2019ve all long relied on huge stores of data to drive performance and measurement. AI is helping us use fewer signals, while driving the intelligence and trusted measurement we need.\nStill, it will take more than a culture of experimentation to capture AI\u2019s full potential. We are making sure we learn and then scale. Only then can we develop a deeper understanding of how and when AI can be deployed to augment and amplify human skills. To make this all as easy as possible to navigate, my team put together a list of AI Essentials that you can use to make sure you have the right AI foundation.\nAs we embark on this journey, what gives us confidence is Google\u2019s bold and responsible approach. AI has incredible potential to benefit our industry, but it is not without risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be responsible from the start. As an example, to address misinformation, Google will soon be integrating new innovations like \u201cabout this image\u201d metadata in Search and image watermarking. We are also using AI to deliver a privacy-first ads experience that drives results for performance marketers while also protecting consumers\u2019 privacy.\nIt\u2019s such an exciting time. The tools and capabilities I could only dream about in my days as a CMO in consumer packaged goods and retail are here \u2014 now. Marketing is about connecting brands and products to people. The \u201cwhat\u201d remains the same. The \u201chow\u201d is changing again. Marketers, we can finally get back to marketing.\nOur marketing teams here at Google have been experimenting with AI tools to be more productive and creative. Take a look."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marketers are told time and again to factor return on investment (ROI) into their media planning decisions, but putting this into practice can be daunting. It doesn\u2019t help that the media landscape is more fragmented than ever, making it difficult to isolate the impact of any given ad placement, let alone optimize for it.\nAt Google, we work closely with clients to improve media measurement and have come to recognize marketing mix models (MMMs) as the most comprehensive way of understanding ROI measurement across different media channels, spanning online and offline.\nAnalyzing a range of advertiser MMM results over the years has also helped us identify the key contributors to ROI growth for YouTube in particular. Our research shows that there are four primary levers of video ROI: creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience.\nOf course, optimizing each of these levers can look quite different from one advertiser to the next. Every marketer should experiment to understand what works best. Doing so will help them confidently make decisions around their campaigns, resulting not only in better ads but better returns.\nTo understand how each of these work, let\u2019s walk through the stories of four brands that discovered firsthand how these levers increased their ROI.\nResearch has shown that effective creative accounts for almost 50% of ROI.1 Google analysts and researchers have studied thousands of ads to understand what specific elements drive performance on YouTube. We call these elements the ABCD principles: attention, branding, connection, and direction. According to research conducted by Nielsen, ads following the ABCD principles saw a 30% higher sales lift than ads that didn\u2019t adhere to them.2 Google sales teams are equipped to help brands analyze and optimize their creative for YouTube to drive greater business impact.\nShapermint, a global e-commerce brand, wanted to both boost its brand and drive product sales. Over the course of seven weeks, it ran experiments to understand what combination of creative drove the best results in its YouTube ad campaigns. By alternating among user testimonials, product demos, and a special offer, each video had its own unique angle. Shapermint tested the impact of its messaging along with other creative levers, such as length and pacing. As a result, the brand found its optimal combination of creative, assembling a powerful mix that lowered its cost per acquisition (CPA) by 21% and drove 50% more purchases.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start by building out the foundation of your video creative according to the ABCDs, and then try experimenting with various creative elements to see what works best for your audience.\nDifferent YouTube formats serve different objectives, but research shows that full-funnel strategies consistently deliver higher ROI. Brands that combine both awareness and action YouTube ad formats as part of a full-funnel strategy see higher ROI than when using either one in isolation. Based on a custom Nielsen meta-analysis, a full-funnel YouTube strategy drives 10% higher ROI compared to awareness advertising alone.3\nSulwhasoo is a South Korean luxury skin care brand from Amorepacific. Having surpassed $790 million (1 trillion KRW) in annual sales, it is quite well known. However, it wanted to try leveraging YouTube ads to drive more conversions beyond the awareness campaigns it had historically relied on. For this experimental campaign, Sulwhasoo first used a foundation of awareness and consideration formats to maximize its audience reach. Then it layered in action formats for the first time, turning attention into action. With this YouTube full-funnel strategy, the brand saw a staggering 91% decrease in CPA and a 13.8X increase in conversion rate.\nWhile it might seem intuitive to primarily buy action formats in the pursuit of tangible ROI, advertisers will see higher returns by adding awareness formats. In fact, a recent study shows that YouTube advertisers see Awareness formats driving 28% of their conversion assists.4\nThough reach and frequency are closely knit, each impacts ROI quite differently. All else being equal, increasing reach usually maintains ROI, while increasing frequency past a specific point usually diminishes ad effectiveness. For many advertisers, this well-known rule of thumb can make them fearful of increasing their frequencies. However, most advertisers overindex on cautiousness, and, in reality, have more breathing room to increase frequency on YouTube than they might think. On average, brands can increase average weekly frequency on YouTube from one to three ad exposures without diminishing YouTube ad effectiveness, according to an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen.5\nTo simplify the process, we\u2019ve recently started letting advertisers using Video reach campaigns choose a frequency target of up to five impressions per week, helping them to achieve maximum reach while setting a desired weekly frequency. This leads to a more efficient spend and a better experience for viewers. And we\u2019re piloting YouTube reach and frequency data availability through our MMM data platform to help advertisers understand their measurements better.\nFor example, after including reach and frequency data in its commercial mix modeling program with Analytic Partners, Peloton discovered that its ideal optimization strategy was more nuanced than it had expected. The results showed that there was an opportunity to drive incremental reach after optimizing frequency, leading to a potential ROI improvement of 15%.\nLast but not least, who you show your ads to significantly affects your ROI. Every brand has at least one demographic audience, but adding in audiences based on interests and behaviors can help you reach more potential customers. For example, a beauty brand might want to show its ads to viewers who are watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or a pet food company could choose to show its ads to those who recently searched for \u201cbest organic dog foods.\u201d These nuances can make all the difference in final purchase decisions.\nThe Insights Finder tool helps marketers uncover actionable audience insights related to interests, demographics, and more, using aggregated and anonymized signals from Google and YouTube. These insights allow brands to add new audience segments and to see how their ROI is affected. Oreo used Insights Finder to break down their audience into four segments: Entertainment Fans, Trendsetters, Gamers, and Foodies. The brand created personalized creative for each of these segments and saw an impressive 100% year-over-year improvement in YouTube ROI.\nBy focusing on creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience, advertisers can better understand the contributors to their ROI. Google teams can help brands that are on this journey figure out how to optimize each of these four levers. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen, YouTube return on ad spend grew by 108%, on average, for brands after collaborating with Google, an increase that was 7X greater than seen by brands that did not collaborate with Google.6 Close partnership with our media customers is absolutely key to capturing the power of media mix modeling."

        "input": "",
        "output": "From brushing our teeth in the morning to cleaning the kitchen counter after dinner, home and personal care (HPC) products are an essential part of our daily routines. Because these items are ubiquitous, finding imaginative ways to market them can sometimes be a challenge.\nWe know, however, that when it comes to designing ads to break through the clutter, creative has proved to be a particularly powerful tool for advertisers. Our team analyzed thousands of global HPC ads to understand exactly what kind of creative choices make some of these ads more effective than others. What we found pointed us to five creative insights about what resonates with viewers when it comes to HPC ads.\nResearch and development is how brands differentiate themselves. And while R&D is critically important, how brands communicate those differentiators is just as significant. Rather than using complex terminology (whether it\u2019s a little known ingredient or a reference to a scientific process), help people by simplifying the language or concept into a language they can easily understand.\nFor example, instead of describing technicalities, Liquid Plumr shows its benefits through a straightforward test: a universally relatable experience of a sink clogged by the oatmeal and cucumber chunks from a home-spa mask. The ad lets the viewer see the product\u2019s capabilities rather than explaining it, as one pour of Liquid Plumr clears away the clog in a single satisfying visual.\nRather than trying to hit the entire marketing funnel with a single ad, consider the creative choices that accurately address a specific objective. What works to effectively drive short-term sales goals looks quite different from ads that are focused on long-term brand equity. Ads focused on brand building can often benefit from a longer, more creative story, whereas ads focused on short-term sales and performance work the hardest when the focus is on the product itself.1\nWith the release of their new vacuum cleaner model, Bosch Hausger\u00e4te (Domestic Appliances) created a 20-second spot showing the product in action and focusing on one key feature, an approach that proved to be effective in driving short-term sales. However, when it came to creating their brand campaign, Bosch took a very different creative path. The minute-long spot featured a cast of several characters, each with distinct storylines tied together by the campaign slogan #LikeABosch, showing all the ways Bosch can play a role in our everyday lives.\nPersonal care products are just that: personal. People want to see that the product can fit into their everyday lifestyle, and being seen in that process is important. To reach all of your consumers, consider who you\u2019re portraying in your campaigns. More inclusive representation across ethnicities, ages, and genders can drive greater engagement and help your consumers connect with your brand proposition. In fact, representation is the No. 1 driver for ad recall for HPC ads, proving that integrating diversity into your ads can leave a lasting impression.2\nAll Good, a diaper brand focused on sustainability and clean ingredients, made sure to speak to all parents with its campaign. Recognizing that all kinds of families exist \u2014 whether interracial, young, single-parent \u2014 it acknowledges that many parenting struggles are universal no matter who you are. This allows viewers to connect with the brand in a more authentic, genuine way, simply by being seen and heard.\nPeople don\u2019t always have a strong emotional connection to products, especially when it comes to everyday things in home and personal care. Building that connection is vital to engagement and can help a brand stand out. Having a creative, evocative storyline that goes beyond the product can go a long way in capturing a viewer\u2019s attention.\nVeet France\u2019s \u201cYour hair, your choice, our products\u201d campaign walks through a number of poignant vignettes of various women: with a lover in bed, at a lively summertime party, laying in the grass, and admiring their arm hair. By showing a range of body types and body hair, it tells a story of the many different ways one can be a woman. A single overlying narration directly addressing the audience helps send a message about everyone being entitled to their own opinions on their bodies and body hair. Though its products are touted as a way of helping people do whatever they want with their hair, the story goes far beyond the product line.\nPeople usually don\u2019t think about what personal care products sound like, but the use of audio can evoke memories, help us more easily contextualize something, or amplify messaging. Audio is an underutilized resource in video ads despite it being one of the most effective ways to drive lift across brand metrics. Use it to amplify any visual element, like brand names or supers. Audio can also be used for product usage cues, like the spray of a bottle or the splash of a product pour.\nDowny Korea promoted its Puff laundry detergent with a short but evocative spot. When the character squeezes the puff, a sound effect emphasizes the satisfying, squishy texture, allowing the viewer to imagine what it feels like without being able to touch the product. Then, as the puff hits the laundry water, it bursts with an explosive sound. The dramatic, powerful sound communicates how vigorous its cleaning capabilities are.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why these five data-backed tactics can benefit the creative for your next HPC ad. They\u2019ll serve as a starting point for building a strong foundation as you apply your own creative angles that are true to your brand. And to really maximize your ads\u2019 effectiveness, remember to continually experiment with your creative to understand what truly drives the best results for your brand and audience."

        "input": "",
        "output": "At YouTube, we\u2019ve analyzed the content and creators that broke through in 2022 to uncover the global insights and themes we believe will help define consumer trends in 2023. Based on what we found, we\u2019ve identified three ways marketers can take inspiration from successful creators to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with their audiences.\nThe most successful marketing shows an understanding of what motivates an audience to engage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to value online communities and understand how they can amplify and strengthen your messages.\nCreators excel at this. The top YouTube content of 2022 demonstrates how creators can inspire active engagement from their communities through moments that capture public attention. In the U.K., for example, British YouTubers Sidemen brought together audiences from many top creators to raise over $1 million during their charity football match. Meanwhile, in the U.S., American creator MrBeast made YouTube\u2019s 2022 year-end list for top 10 creators with a Willy Wonka-themed challenge video, featuring contestants from his fan base. And in Germany, the continued success of collaboration duo 7 vs. Wild can be partly attributed to their viewers, who share their takes in scores of reaction videos.\nAcross moments and geographies, viewers are forging connections with communities online that they may not interact with elsewhere. Indeed, 55% of Gen Z agree that they watch content that no one they know personally is interested in.1\nThe takeaway for marketers? Find ways to encourage participation from online groups who have specific personal interests and lean into them. By doing so, you can create brand moments with greater impact and meaning.\nIn 2022, audience interest spanned multiple formats and content categories, and their preferences often changed based on their mindset and the moment. While this trend may seem like an obstacle, it presents a great opportunity for marketers to follow the lead of creators who successfully reach new audiences by meeting them where they are.\nIn the past year, creators who told stories across multiple formats had the fastest growing audiences. For instance, Indonesian swimmer Timotius Mulyadi, whose long-form videos usually clock in at over eight minutes long, experimented with 60-second swimming tutorials, which made him one of his country\u2019s breakout creators last year.\nFact is, engaging audiences successfully in one format often means that viewers will follow you from screen to screen. Our research shows that 59% of Gen Z agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nShakira successfully capitalized on this behavior when she promoted the release of her latest song with Rauw Alejandro, \u201cTe Felecito.\u201d Instead of simply launching the music video, she used a series of Shorts to excite fans and encourage them to watch the full video experience. First, she sparked curiosity by inserting teasers from her new video into the YouTube thumbnails of her all-time classic videos. Then she released a preview of her new video on YouTube Shorts. Finally, she launched a group of Shorts that taught viewers how to do the video\u2019s choreography, which sparked a new dance challenge. This creative use of multiformat content helped her music video become the sixth most-watched in Mexico in 2022 according to YouTube Music trends.\nMeeting your audience where they are also means speaking their language, sometimes quite literally. MrBeast showed up on top creator lists in Brazil and France by using dubbed language channels. Meanwhile, Brazilian creator Jooj Natu\u2019s English-language channel helped him extend his reach into the U.S. and Canada.\nWhile marketers can take inspiration from the multiformat success of these creators, they can also engage with new audiences in a very simple and attainable way. According to a Google study, adding a vertical creative asset to a Video action campaign delivered 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts than using landscape assets alone.3\nIn the past, viral short-form videos often resulted from accidental, random moments captured on camera. But these days, Shorts are less off-the-cuff, and more crafted and intentional.\nThe Shorts that attract the largest audiences have been specifically designed to recreate the spontaneous feel of those older videos, with deliberate moments of surprise and delight. For creative inspiration, marketers can look to circus acrobat Jake Hinga, who found Shorts success by capturing him and his friends undertaking elaborate trampoline challenges. Alternatively, they can see how Chris Ivan, the king of toilet plunger trick shots, reached 80 million views by collaborating with restaurant business, Dave & Busters.\nBut Shorts don\u2019t need to seem spontaneous to be successful. Last year, comedy creators attracted audiences with character-driven sketches and parodies. Take Germany\u2019s Anna Strigl, who encouraged environmental activism in one of the country\u2019s most viewed Shorts of the year.\nThe most important takeaway for marketers is that the best short-form videos embrace the format\u2019s strength and encourage people to watch them again and again. What does this mean exactly? According to our list of top creator tips, one major thing marketers need to do is give their Shorts an immediate hook. As The Korean Vegan, a U.S.-based cooking creator, says, \u201cThe first one to two seconds are the most important. That hook better be visually, audibly, and intellectually irresistible.\u201d\nLeveraging communities, meeting audiences where they are, and creating innovative Shorts aren\u2019t just YouTube strategies. Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the way audience expectations are evolving. Marketers who incorporate these actions into their creative will empower themselves to successfully connect with the right audiences at the right moments in 2023 and beyond."

Now, YouTube is a place that millions go to witness major cultural events. But even beyond that, people are turning to YouTube to experience the moments around these moments.\nTake me, for example. I recently watched Silk Sonic\u2019s 64th Grammy Awards performance on YouTube. Then I found myself watching video after video of related content, like Kyle Hanagami\u2019s choreography to a Silk Sonic song. I went from enjoying one performance at a major event to digging deeper into the culture surrounding that performance.\nThis type of watch behavior is ubiquitous on YouTube, and it gives brands the unique opportunity to make advertising budgets go further and work harder. Recent campaigns from Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z International are proof of this. Here\u2019s how each company successfully used YouTube to stand out, extend its reach, and increase brand awareness during a key tentpole moment.\nLast year, Hyundai planned to debut its new electric vehicle (EV), the Ioniq 5, during the Super Bowl. Angela Zepeda, Hyundai\u2019s CMO, says, \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center.\u201d\nWith more people watching live sports online, Hyundai wisely opted for a multimedia campaign. It aired a TV spot during both the NFL\u2019s AFC and NFC Championship games and again during the Super Bowl pregame show. However, in contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai went digital-first during the Super Bowl.\nAs Zepeda explains, \u201cWe know that digital-first audiences care deeply about keeping their pulse on the cultural zeitgeist, but are less likely to have standard cable and more likely to be cord-cutters. That\u2019s where YouTube came in.\u201d After consulting a Nielsen study showing YouTube as the leader in streaming watch time in the U.S., Hyundai felt confident that the platform would put them front and center with its audience.\nCore to Hyundai\u2019s digital-first approach was investing in YouTube AdBlitz inventory and surrounding its ads with Super Bowl-related content. This included videos directly related to the big game, such as NFL highlight footage, along with content tangentially related to the Super Bowl, like recipes and cooking demonstrations geared toward foodies and tailgaters. By doing so, Hyundai extended its reach beyond the mainstream Super Bowl culture and tapped into the event\u2019s subcultures.\nTiming was also integral to Hyundai\u2019s approach. The company extended its campaign to run for a full month, which allowed it to become part of the Super Bowl hype in the weeks leading up to and following the game.\nThis video content strategy paid off. After the campaign generated more than 247 million impressions, Hyundai became a big brand winner of the AdBlitz 2022 contest, an honor given to brands who receive the most views on their Super Bowl commercial. Additionally, by starting its campaign early during off-peak days, the brand also reduced its cost per unique view by 50% compared to a traditional Super Bowl buy.\nFor Pride Month this year, bubly partnered with the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, and the chosen families and safe places that allow its members to flourish. As part of the partnership, the brand created a short film called Coming Home, which offered a simple, yet powerful message: Everyone deserves a family.\nTo promote the film and ensure it got the viewership and engagement it deserved, bubly knew it was important to find the right platform. As Conor Dwyer, brand communications lead at PepsiCo, explains, \u201cYouTube was among the only platforms where we could functionally and efficiently deliver a video ad that surpassed two minutes and reach an audience already primed for viewing long-form content.\u201d YouTube also helped bubly\u2019s film reach a wider range of relevant audiences through behavioral and contextual targeting, including affinity segments like LGBTQ Content Enthusiasts, and ensure it appeared alongside relevant content.\nWith the power of YouTube behind it, the film earned more than 6 million views and a view rate above 50%. The film also drove heightened interest in the brand, which saw a 1091% relative lift in searches for \u201cbubly.\u201d\nMondel\u0113z decided to promote its Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand during Italy\u2019s biggest national music festival and song contest, the Sanremo Music Festival. This involved sponsoring the YouTube channels for the artists in the festival and running a YouTube homepage masthead during the weeklong event. The brand chose YouTube because it knew the platform would be ideal for immersing in the excitement of the festival and reaching as many music fans as possible. It was a smart strategy, as music streaming had been growing in popularity since the start of the pandemic, especially on YouTube.\nTo reach the largest online audience possible, Mondel\u0113z ran a 25% share of voice YouTube campaign, which guarantees advertisers a set percentage of ads around certain content groups. For Mondel\u0113z, that meant its campaign could run on the official YouTube channels of all the top artists competing in the Sanremo festival. Mondel\u0113z not only extended its campaign reach by leaning into the momentum from the main event, but also by tapping into the excitement before, during, and after the festival.\nMondel\u0113z also secured a YouTube masthead ad exclusively on connected TV. This helped the brand reach a new, fast-growing base of connected TV viewers and keep the Philadelphia brand front and center over the course of the festival.\nIn the end, Mondel\u0113z\u2019 connected TV masthead increased its reach by 30%, and the overall campaign successfully reached 5.4 million unique users, garnering almost 20 million impressions in just 14 days.\nAs video viewers increasingly gravitate online, innovative companies like Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z show that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply run ads during tentpole moments. Instead, these companies found wider audiences and increased brand awareness by leveraging YouTube to tap into the subculture and tangential moments around the Super Bowl, Pride Month, and Sanremo Music Festival. Their strategies and resulting success can inspire brands of all sizes to find greater reach and new fans on YouTube."

        "output": "A few weeks ago, I experienced a quintessential New York moment. I was double parked on the busy street outside my New York City apartment, desperately trying to install a car seat I had recently purchased for my 3-year-old daughter. At any moment, I knew I could be honked at for blocking other cars.\nSo I quickly whipped out my phone and headed to the Car Seat Lady on YouTube, a channel I frequently consult when I\u2019m in the market to buy a new car seat and in stressful parenting moments like this. There, I knew I could find step-by-step instructions and incredibly accurate estimates of how long it would take someone like me to install a brand-new car seat in a high-pressure situation.\nMy experience isn\u2019t unique. People all over the world turn to YouTube for help with products they just bought. In fact, they\u2019re relying on YouTube for guidance and information during every part of their shopping journey, whether they\u2019re watching unboxing videos, getting product reviews, or learning from how-to videos. This is particularly true of Gen Z, who say that YouTube is more likely than other video and social media platform to meet their top shopping needs.1\nBut what exactly makes YouTube such a magnet for shoppers? And how can brands benefit from this close relationship between YouTube and its audience? To find out, we partnered with Talk Shoppe to conduct an extensive, qualitative research study and surveyed thousands of video users in the U.S. From our findings, we\u2019ve extracted three shopping insights that can help build brand loyalty and create repeat customers on YouTube.\nYes, discovering new and exciting brands online is important to shoppers. But what they value even more is finding reliable, trustworthy information that will help them buy a product with confidence. And, according to our research, viewers say YouTube ranks no. 1 against video services and social media platforms in key shopping needs, like finding honest information and feeling good about their purchases.2\nYouTube creators are a large part of the reason why people view the platform as a source of solid information, with 87% of viewers agreeing that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.3 As one of our survey participants said, \u201cYouTubers often give updates on how the product is doing three, six, or 12 months after purchasing, and they also will warn you about things to look out for.\u201d\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, 24 markets (AR, AU, BR, CL, CO, FR, DE, ID, IT, IN, JP, KR, MX, PE, PH, NZ, NL, ES, SE, TH, VN, AE, U.K., U.S.), n=48,000, 18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 20, 2021\u2013Feb. 19, 2022.\nTo explore this further, we spoke with creator-turned-entrepreneur Cassey Ho about how building trust with her YouTube followers contributed to the success of her direct-to-consumer brand, Popflex.\nFor over 13 years, Ho established herself as an authentic, trustworthy creator and CEO by sharing free workout videos on her Blogilates YouTube channel. \u201cFans would see me wearing my products or showcasing them in the background. They started asking me for a longer hoodie or a hoodie with a bigger hood to cover their long hair. What has really helped me build trust \u2026 is that I will take those comments as inspiration to develop my products. People felt heard.\u201d\nWhen we asked Gen Z what they prioritize when they shop using video or social platforms, they ranked finding a brand they love significantly higher than finding something trendy.4 This, of course, is great news for brands who hope to become a go-to destination for Gen Z and other shoppers. But exactly how do they become that universally loved brand? They can achieve this by creating a positive shopping experience that encourages people to buy from them again and again.\nThe key to a positive shopping experience is giving people product information they can trust, which will make them more satisfied with their final purchase. And our research showed that YouTube helps brands build this basis of trust. As one of our Gen Z survey participants stated, \u201cAfter buying something that I\u2019ve actually done research on [through] YouTube, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever returned anything.\u201d YouTube also helps brands win customers\u2019 loyalty, with 85% of people who use YouTube in their shopping journey saying they have purchased or planned to purchase a brand again.5\nSource: Google/TalkShoppe, U.S., Social Commerce and Video Shopping study, n=2,000 gen. pop. 18\u201364, Aug. 2022.\nWhile shoppers trust creators\u2019 recommendations and the information they find on YouTube, can the same be said about video ads? As part of our research, Talk Shoppe conducted a test to find out how people really feel about the ads they see. They created an ad for an imaginary coffee brand and showed survey participants how this ad might look on different online platforms. Participants were then asked to quickly associate the brand in the ad with certain words.\nThe test results showed that people trusted a brand much more when they saw it on a platform they trusted. More specifically, ads on YouTube were rated significantly more trustworthy, established, and credible than they were on every other platform.6 Thus, our research shows that brands can enjoy a halo effect \u2014 positive association \u2014 from the platforms or services they advertise on, which is vital information for brand marketers who want to get the most out of their media dollars.\nThese three shopper insights can help brands leverage the implicit trust people have in YouTube and its creators. By tapping into the satisfaction shoppers have when YouTube is part of their shopping journey and by benefiting from YouTube\u2019s halo effect, brands can turn one-time buyers into long-term loyal, repeat customers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you ask a room full of advertisers, \u201cWhat makes a good video ad?\u201d you\u2019ll likely get a wide range of responses. But most will agree that good creative drives results. According to Nielsen, creative is responsible for almost half of a campaign\u2019s success.1 And when I recently ran a YouTube CMO roundtable, many clients spoke to creative customization and experimentation as key components of their success. Their experiences support the insight that relevance to viewers maximizes impact. Because different content resonates with different viewers, campaigns containing several versions of the same creative, each tailored to a specific audience, can be very effective.\nAdvancements in technology have led viewers to expect more relevance, thanks to a proliferation of choice. Now, ad creative must transform to meet those expectations. We developed Ads Creative Studio to streamline the production process by helping brands and agencies cut down on time and costs, and to facilitate collaboration between media and creative teams. Here\u2019s how two brands and an agency used the platform to create more effective ads.\nCustomization has always been a key part of PepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy, but their sparkling water brand bubly\u2019s impact on brand associations still had to be tested. The team wanted to find out how customized video ads for the brand might encourage their ideal audiences to associate it with house parties, barbecues, sports viewing, and other consumption moments. The goal? To deliver on a brief to better understand the consumer and eventually win them over.\nWith this experiment, PepsiCo wanted to gauge which of those occasion-specific messages, when aimed at relevant audiences, would resonate the most. With Ads Creative Studio, the process of building out a collection of customized assets became smoother and more efficient. The suite of tools allowed the teams to keep production internal by housing all design elements on a single platform.\n\u201cPrior to using Ads Creative Studio for video customization, we planned a high-level creative and targeting approach,\u201d said Terrence McLaughlin, associate marketing manager at PepsiCo. However, after using the tool to inventory creative variables to personalize, each with its own designated audience, they realized they had to adapt their creative process to be more tactical. \u201cAfter seeing the Ads Creative Studio user flow, we had to break down the elements of our proposed creative to mimic the framework in the platform.\u201d\nWith a single tool, the PepsiCo team was able to standardize processes across functions. As a result, the team found that campaigns with creative depicting social gathering and food pairing situations were most effective at driving brand lift. Equipped with that knowledge, teams can now craft bubly\u2019s stories around themes they know resonate with audiences they want to reach.\nWhen General Motors South America wanted to boost brand awareness of the Cruze 5 model, they decided to lean on customization beyond the basics. Drawing on Google insights, they created an audience strategy that relied on a collection of 14 different groups, including affinity audiences like \u201coutdoor enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cthrill seekers,\u201d and \u201cbeachbound travelers,\u201d as well as contextual audiences: those watching various types of auto-related content on YouTube. Each of these 14 groups would see an ad customized specifically to what would resonate with them.\nThe team was faced with the question of how to produce 14 unique ads, without sacrificing time, budget, or resources. They opted to try Ads Creative Studio.\n\u201cIt allows you to increase productivity and efficiency, both creatively and from media costs and metrics,\u201d said Gianluca Schinocca, media coordinator for GM Argentina. \u201cAmong the many benefits of Ads Creative Studio, production time saving and the large amount of videos produced are the ones that we found most impactful. We also reduced 30% in terms of costs, and, after the campaign, we noticed a huge increase in product searches.\u201d\nFor a true win, GM knew they would need measurable results in brand lift and search. In the end, with a 56% increase in Google searches for \u201cchevrolet cruze\u201d2 and a cost per view 32% less than the industry benchmark, the experiment was a success.\nFrom the agency perspective, Ads Creative Studio can eliminate the swirl that sometimes comes with ambitious undertakings. Creative agencies around the world are constantly dealing with gridlock in approvals and workflows. Men in Green, a Dutch creative agency, found that the suite of tools made it easier for designers to share and edit work. \u201cIt is the perfect solution for our challenge,\u201d said Jaap den Hertog, founder and CEO of Men in Green. \u201cIt gives a risk-free environment for designers to build [ad] creatives. It also allows for easy collaboration between multiple designers.\u201d\nPreviously, to maintain high production standards, Men in Green had strict quality controls in place that only allowed for senior designers to produce data-driven ad creatives within Display & Video 360. That meant junior designers could not create design variations, even when the team needed them. Because Ads Creative Studio is integrated into Display & Video 360, junior designers can now make their own ad creatives, halving the time it takes to deliver work and allowing senior designers to focus on quality assurance and publishing.\nTo their clients\u2019 delight, the data-driven ad creatives with tailored messaging decreased production costs significantly. When leading bath and body brand company Rituals was looking for a way to promote their Easter collection, Men in Green used templates to create personalized messages for each market. Not only did they save time and resources, but they also saw a 278% higher click-through rate, 64% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and 103% higher conversion rate compared to standard IAB banners.\nCreative is fundamental to campaign success. No matter what your goals are, a centralized suite of tools can be used to drive both efficiency and scale. By reducing barriers and enhancing efficiency, Ads Creative Studio makes it easier for teams to collaborate and create personalized assets quickly, at low cost. Coupled with video experimentation, these tools allowed three different organizations to determine the most effective story to engage each of their unique audiences."

        "output": "To explore the future impact of transformational changes in the creative realm, Google is partnering with Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 industry trailblazers on the Open Creative Project: an effort that brings together market analysis and insights from a series of in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders to encourage dialogue about the future of our industry. Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, shares early takeaways from the project.\nThe term \u201ccreative\u201d used to refer to a special class within the ad world: teams with a particular skill set who often sat apart, literally and figuratively, from the rest of their organizations. But when a pandemic forced all of us into digital spaces as safe havens to work and play, \u201ccreative\u201d took on a larger meaning.\nPeople who never went to design school or drafted a creative brief got more comfortable being their authentic selves online. Unknown chefs shared their passion for cooking on YouTube and discovered a global audience hungry for more. Gamers live streamed their adventures to thousands \u2014 sometimes millions \u2014 of rapt fans. In myriad new ways and spaces, everyday people started to share their stories, and some even partnered with brands to become powerful co-storytellers.\nMarketers and agencies, too, had to get more creative in solving clients\u2019 challenges, forging meaningful connections with consumers, and measuring success. And as marketers learned how to leverage new tools for creative automation, experimentation, assistance, and measurement, they grew more comfortable sharing ownership of a brand identity with the online communities organically remixing it. Together with those communities, they remade marketing and found fresh opportunities.\nAll of this adds up to more than just a \u201cthings are different now\u201d moment.\nFor us at Google, the combination of changes in consumer behavior, the rise of machine learning, the flourishing of user expression in unscripted spaces, and macroeconomic pressures felt like an inflection point for the industry, one where creative is poised to become the last unfair advantage.\nWith automation flattening media-driven returns, creative is becoming one of the most effective levers to drive differentiation and return on investment, and creative spend is increasing faster than media spend (6% versus 5% annually between 2018 and 2021).1 Knowing that these trends deserved a deep dive, we partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 including Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 creative industry trailblazers \u2014 on what we\u2019re calling the Open Creative Project.\nThrough intensive market analysis and in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders and trailblazers, we\u2019ve begun a thorough exploration of the why, the how, and the future impact of transformational changes already underway in the creative arena. And, over and over, we\u2019ve seen that concepts that once felt oppositional \u2014 art and science, unscripted expression and brand voice, advertising creators and users, brand and performance, imagination and automation \u2014 are increasingly interdependent.\nOur goal is to spark a new dialogue focused on the role creative will play in the broader advertising industry over the next three to five years. While this conversation will surely be shaped by the contributions and feedback of the entire advertising industry, we\u2019ve already keyed in on a few areas that present some of the biggest opportunities for marketers and brands.\nA natural place to start is with the rise of the creator economy, one of the strongest signals we have of where the future of creative \u2014 and all of marketing \u2014 is headed.\nThe explosion of truly unique and innovative content the ad industry has seen over the past three years is a direct product of a global cohort of diverse new voices adding their perspectives and contributions to the traditional marketing mix across old and new platforms. Case in point: Influencer marketing payments to creators for creative advertising services grew 50% annually between 2018 and 2021.2\nThe term \u201cowned media\u201d is now a relative one. Not only does every consumer have the tools to amplify, challenge, or riff on your brand\u2019s message through their personal channels and unscripted spaces, but so do thousands of influential creators with their own massive audiences and points of view.\nAnd experimentation, the willingness to try something new or different that\u2019s so key to creativity, is fast becoming a core competency \u2014 especially with the proliferation of tools that enable experimentation.\nThere are lessons here for organizations and brands ready to break creativity out of its silo. By being open to more active collaboration with creators around a shared point of view, brands can foster a more exciting and authentic conversation with their audiences. And there is value in thinking about the \u201ccreative team\u201d as everyone from CEO to the finance team.\nThere\u2019s no question that the relationships between digital platforms and the people who use them are being reshaped.\nBut amid the noise of an internet that offers everything, all the time, how can brands connect with the right people in a way that sticks? The answer lies in the new value exchange that\u2019s redefining how, when, and why brands earn people\u2019s attention, satisfaction, and trust. It\u2019s an exchange that only works reciprocally.\nIn other words, people already understand data\u2019s value for advertisers. When people appreciate the value and benefits they receive from the data they share, the more they trust a brand to handle that data responsibly, and the more comfortable they are with the exchange.\nTo provide a convincing answer to the consumer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d, brands have to deliver empathy at scale by demonstrating a deep understanding of every customer\u2019s (and potential customer\u2019s) needs and the company\u2019s ability to meet those needs. And there\u2019s no better way to speak authentically to the widest possible audience, in the most personal terms, than great creative.\nWith all of the hats they must wear today, it\u2019s fair for marketers to wonder, \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\nBut marketers and agencies can make their jobs simpler and easier on multiple fronts by doing a single thing: embracing automation as a collaborator rather than a competitor. That\u2019s because automation and machine learning can do things that human brains can\u2019t do: connect dots at scale, uncover new insights, free up time across teams, and infuse even more creativity into organizations.\nTake the example of measurement. With so many new content formats, marketers have more data to measure than ever before. But data is only as useful as our ability to interpret and apply it, and automation is a proven tool to drive better performance via modeling.\nAdvertisers are beginning to realize this. Third-party ad technology that supports creativity \u2014 including digital asset management, dynamic creative optimization, advertising attribution, creative applications, and influencer marketing platforms \u2014 saw growth rates ranging from 10% to 30% annually between 2020 and 2021.3\nSo the shift is underway. Of course, automation-enabled measurement doesn\u2019t only make for better creative. Creative thinking can improve the ways we measure.\nToday\u2019s shopping experience extends far outside the store and into the live-streaming, social, and physical worlds.\nAnd as the creator economy flowers across augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming, brands are coming to life across a multiplicity of new dimensions. The implication for brands? Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to convert, and the entire commerce journey is an ever-expanding web of touchpoints where brand building can happen at any time.\nBrands that unlock new ways to stand out in the age of everywhere commerce will define the future of creative advertising.\nWith these ideas as thought-starters, on behalf of our Open Creative Project co-collaborators, we\u2019re excited to open up the conversation to a wider audience. In the coming months, we\u2019ll invite you to dive into a full version of the research report summarized here, followed by a series of contributions from some of the leading voices in creative advertising. We look forward to adding their insights, and more from across the industry, as we endeavor to explore, define, and invent the future of creative, together."

Strategic decisions tend to get magnified in times like these, and brands often respond by leaning into what they know: tried-and-true advertising tactics that deliver consistent results. While doubling down on what\u2019s familiar is better than doing nothing at all, marketers shouldn\u2019t stop there.\nSearch, video, and insights are tried-and-true advertising channels. Brands know how to leverage them to capture growth and build resilience. But brands also need to supplement their trusted playbooks with the increased insight, speed, and agility that comes from machine learning and automation. We call this combination of tried-and-true approaches and fresh new ways of working the \u201ctried-and-new.\u201d\nHaving served in a variety of roles across the industry, including CMO at Time Warner and chief business officer at Hearst, I\u2019ve experienced challenging times firsthand. Managing the marketing budgets and strategies that many of you hold right now through moments of uncertainty is the moment to focus on purposeful experimentation and lean into the tried-and-new framework. This doesn\u2019t require dramatic changes or major new investments. What it does require is prioritization, flexibility, and a learning mindset. Many leading brands have used this approach to go beyond the performance-oriented tools they\u2019ve relied on in the past to drive better business outcomes. Here are the big takeaways.\nConsumer behaviors, needs, and preferences change from moment to moment, which we see reflected in search. Among the billions of searches on Google everyday, 15% are queries we\u2019ve never seen.1\nWe know that search drives conversions. But with machine learning, you can quickly identify which new searches (or users) are most valuable to your business based on your goals. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve found that full search automation can help advertisers increase conversions by up to 20% for a similar cost per acquisition.2 This is a huge uptick when you are being asked to squeeze more value from every dollar and every campaign.\nWe can see this in action with Rothy\u2019s, a shoe and accessory retailer that relies on video and lifestyle imagery to showcase the quality and colorful nature of their products. The brand adopted automation to surface creative assets to customers at scale across all of Google\u2019s channels, including Search, Display, Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. At first Rothy\u2019s hesitated to automate such important decisions, but \u201cthe results spoke for themselves,\u201d explains Kate Barrows, Rothy\u2019s VP of growth. \u201cAutomation stays on top of customer trends and behavior faster than we can.\u201d The brand grew conversions by 60% and increased revenue by 59%.\nWhat could your brand achieve by offloading commoditized and manual tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work? When you think in those terms, you will begin to see automation as a business multiplier that scales what\u2019s working for your brand, your team, and your partners.\nRemoving tedious tasks, like manually setting your dayparting strategy or building keyword lists, enables your most valuable resource, your people, to infuse more of their own judgment, expertise, and ingenuity into the work. This may mean having the time to focus on building a strategy that expands beyond lower-funnel strategies to develop more holistic, full-funnel marketing campaigns. Or it\u2019s a chance to go deeper on your creative strategy.\nDiscovery+, the streaming platform, adopted Performance Max to improve how it optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. In this case, automation unlocked new audience trends that Discovery+ used to better refine the creative and messaging around their shows. This also freed up time to reinvest into developing a comprehensive media strategy to further drive growth. The strategy worked: Discovery+ increased incremental subscriptions by 17% and decreased cost of acquisition by 21% in a highly competitive category.\nMarketing often suffers from the misperception that it operates as a cost center. Reframing marketing as a growth driver requires speaking a new language, moving beyond proxy metrics like brand awareness or engagement to focus on business performance. Speaking a shared language with the CFO means measuring business outcomes through better use of data, technology, and machine learning.\nWhen you know the value of your customers and you combine that knowledge with AI and machine learning, your campaigns can begin to shift advertising dollars in real time to the most profitable pockets of demand. This is critical, because tying incremental marketing investments to year-over-year sales growth not only increases revenue but also reduces acquisition costs, leading to more profitable revenue. In fact, CMOs who can translate their metrics into business impact are 37% more likely to report revenue growth compared to leaders that communicate strictly in marketing language.3\nFor example, as part of its first-party data strategy, PepsiCo invested in strengthening direct relationships with their consumers by offering a loyalty rewards program that personalizes experiences and optimizes offers based on the individual\u2019s preferences. This enabled their teams to demonstrate results that tied more directly to sales, in contrast with traditional tactics like mass distributions, promotions, and broad communications that were harder to measure. For example, the food and beverage brand embedded its first-party data in its media planning and buying on YouTube. Not only did their media efficiency improve, but for some campaigns ROI increased by 3X. They also leverage this data to make better informed business decisions on new flavor testings, focus groups, and product samplings.\nDelivering continued growth means striking a balance between tested techniques that deliver consistent returns, and the potential upside of new ideas. Brave marketers have long championed this shift. It\u2019s about remaining agile to manage through the now, while being ready for what\u2019s next."

        "output": "Digital transformation is a journey, not a destination. While every journey will be different, we can learn from leading brands as they advance their digital maturity. Here, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global CMO, Aude Gandon, takes us through the company\u2019s approach to global digital marketing.\nStaying relevant in today\u2019s dynamic environment requires embracing constant change. And as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global Chief Marketing Officer, my mission is to accelerate our marketing digital transformation across the entire organization.\nAs a 156-year-old company with more than 2,000 brands \u2014 including icons like Kit Kat, Nespresso, and Purina \u2014 we believe that data and technology, along with our organization\u2019s ability to adopt and activate quickly, are key to maintaining a competitive advantage.\nPart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s success lies in how we\u2019re able to attribute our digital investments to our top and bottom lines. We recently updated our investors on our digital transformation journey by explaining how we\u2019re using data to reach and resonate with consumers at scale, and how that powers growth across our portfolio.\nIn particular, we\u2019ve identified three key areas that are critical to our success and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in: privacy-preserving fundamentals, valuable consumer connections, and ongoing experimentation. Here\u2019s how we approach each one.\nThe first key to our success is a sharp focus on privacy-preserving fundamentals. A critical part of my role as global CMO is to help Nestl\u00e9 navigate the changing advertising landscape, especially as third-party data collection phases out. By treating data protection and privacy as paramount, we've accelerated the use of privacy-preserving technologies across our organization, ensuring that our first-party strategy is future-proof. This means our brands can access high-quality data and continue to deliver personalized experiences online.\nTo drive our privacy strategy, we\u2019ve developed and delivered a global advertising-technology roadmap across all our markets and brands. Doing so has helped us take advantage of privacy features, like consent mode within Google Analytics 4 (GA4), through which we can communicate users\u2019 cookie- and app-identifier consent status to Google. Tags will then automatically adjust behavior and respect users\u2019 choices. In turn, we\u2019re able to safely improve our understanding of consumers across platforms and deliver richer experiences online.\nLastly, we recognize that staying up-to-date on new privacy capabilities requires us to invest in upskilling programs for our talented teams of brand builders around the world. By empowering our marketers to deeply understand the impact and value a technology unlocks, we can accelerate our transformation and put our company on the path to competitive advantage.\nOur second key focus is on building and fostering valuable consumer connections. In particular, our goal is to reach 400 million consumers with our first-party database by 2025. Having direct access to our first-party data \u2014 and turning this data into actionable insight \u2014 is a critical competitive advantage with immediate value for our brands.\nBy moving toward a first-party, data-driven approach and leveraging Google\u2019s privacy-preserving advertising and analytics tools, we\u2019ve increased our ability to offer personalized solutions in real time, track ROI, and improve sales performance. This ultimately helps us make smarter investments, especially amid economic uncertainty, when it is more critical than ever to understand the value of media spend.\nOne powerful example of this is our food brand Maggi\u2019s use of first-party data to inform dynamic ad creative and better connect with consumers in the Middle East during seasonal moments and other special occasions. By taking this approach, the Maggi team improved its return on ad spend by 25%.\nAnother example is how we leverage new audience capabilities to derive value from our first-party data. Solutions such as Google\u2019s advanced look-alike modeling, currently available in beta, gives us more transparency and control when building audience segments by combining our first-party data with Google\u2019s consumer intent signals. Already, this technology has improved our media efficiency and helped drive a 25% uplift in ad recall for one of our pet care brands in the U.K.\nOur final key focus is on experimentation and fostering a culture of experimentation across our marketing teams. To do this, we lean heavily on cloud capabilities that give us the flexibility to try new technologies while strengthening consumer privacy and growing our first-party data. Our \u201cCloud-in-a-Box\u201d program, for example, gives our brands scalable blueprints to unlock the value of machine learning and other predictive technology.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice for our market-leading Nescaf\u00e9 coffee brand in Thailand. Using Cloud-in-a-Box, the Nescaf\u00e9 team routed large volumes of past campaign data to Google Cloud, then used machine learning to predict which creative messages paired with which audiences to deliver the best results on YouTube.\nBy taking this approach, Nescaf\u00e9 improved its cost per view by 17% and invested the money it saved to reach additional audiences, all while boosting ad recall 12%. Most importantly, the team saw up to 90% accuracy in the model\u2019s predictions, when compared with outcomes from the actual campaign.\nBuilding brands that consumers love remains our core marketing ambition. Our continued investment in digital transformation focuses us on understanding and using the power of data and technology to fuel growth potential for tomorrow.\nBy driving a consistent global marketing strategy across the organization, our team has been able to drive change at scale, embracing data and technology to build competitiveness. Our strategic priorities are helping us build resilience through uncertainty, positioning Nestl\u00e9 to achieve long-term growth."

        "output": "Changes are afoot in how people spend their money. Consumers are being more intentional with purchases, making fewer impulse buys, considering more brands, and exploring multiple commerce platforms. Businesses need to move quickly to keep up with this swerve in shopper mindsets, but it can be hard to put change into action amid uncertainty.\nFinding the right balance between tested strategies and emerging tech innovations can revitalize marketing approaches and power long-term growth. At Google, we call this the tried-and-new approach. It\u2019s about doubling down on proven tactics while leaning into new technology to drive success.\nWhat does this look like in practice? We\u2019ve identified a few strategies that position businesses to adopt the tried-and-new, along with examples of two innovative companies that are using Google\u2019s tools to pivot their growth marketing strategy.\nPeople spend more time researching purchase decisions than they once did, and they\u2019re conducting this research across a growing array of platforms. With this change, automation tools have become a critical way for brands to meet their customers across these digital touchpoints.\nA good example of this comes from Est\u00e9e Lauder in Thailand. Despite being one of the world\u2019s largest cosmetic brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder was challenged to keep up with customer search demand as new search queries and keyword combinations emerged daily. People were no longer just searching for terms like \u201cserum,\u201d but new specific searches like \u201cbest serum for the best price\u201d and \u201cbest serum for brightening skin.\u201d\nThe company decided to approach the problem using automation. To capture and convert prospective customers at scale, Est\u00e9e Lauder used Google\u2019s broad match to automate identification of consumers\u2019 keyword searches to make their ads more relevant to prospective customers. The company also adopted Dynamic Search Ads to find exactly what consumers were searching for on Google and used that data to target their ads and fill gaps in their keyword-based campaigns.\nAs a result, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s media performance shot up. Compared to traditional branded keyword campaigns, the company experienced a 15% increase in return on ad spend, a more than 16% rise in conversion value, and an 11% lift in average purchase size.\nKnowing how to reach the most valuable customers and others like them at scale is a powerful growth multiplier. Using automated solutions allows businesses to do this, while controlling what they pay for customer acquisition and tailoring messages to attract customer attention.\nMarketers know they need to measure what matters, but what are the most important metrics when the economic outlook is in flux? Uncertainty signals the need to move beyond traditional proxy marketing metrics and toward the measurement of real business outcomes.\nArizona State University (ASU) had a business goal to enroll more online students for the 2022\u20132023 school year than the year prior \u2014 no small aim given years of declining enrollment across U.S. postsecondary institutions.\nTo drive this outcome, ASU partnered with Google data scientists to use advanced automation solutions in combination with first-party data to identify people who were most likely to enroll at the institution.\nBut ASU needed to embrace new measurement in order to track the results of these solutions and track progress against its goal. The university leaned in to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and adopted Google Tag Manager\u2019s (GTM) server-side tracking. This allowed ASU to measure the results of its first-party targeting, resulting in a 10% increase in observable conversions on its site and an 8% increase in the on-page conversion rate. Adopting GTM tagging also drove a 25% improvement in page load time and 18% improvement in search engine results page position.\nThis increase in conversions drove remarkable impact. For the 2022 fall semester, ASU Online increased enrollment by 6.9% compared to 2021, setting a record for incoming students.\nNew automation solutions handily harnessed the scale of platforms, helping ASU reach the people who were most likely to act at lower cost. And it was able to measure and track this progress in real time using privacy-safe solutions within GA4.\nPreparing for what\u2019s next is always daunting \u2014 and all the more during times of rapid change.\nBut new marketing strategy tools available today can help to augment traditional strategies, deliver reliable results, and drive long-term growth, no matter what disruptions surface. Use the tried-and-new and make your marketing go further."

        "input": "",
        "output": "People encounter more sustainability-related brand messages than ever, and with good reason: According to a recent Harris Poll survey sponsored by Google Cloud, the vast majority (85%) of executives acknowledge that customers are more likely to engage and do business with sustainable brands. Brand commitments to sustainability have proliferated, with sustainability marketing strategies amplifying those commitments \u2014 on food packaging, in car ads, even on energy bills. That means people see a ton of messages about the environment throughout the day. Those messages represent many opportunities to appeal to customers\u2019 values. How they are conveyed is critical to building brand trust.\nWe asked more than 3,000 Americans of different backgrounds to tell us about sustainability messaging that did not resonate with them to get a better understanding of how to connect on this important issue. Using a type of AI called natural language processing, we clustered and analyzed thousands of opinions by theme to identify how people felt about certain visuals, copy, and creative approaches. Here are three of the most common sustainability marketing pitfalls our research revealed.\nU.S. survey respondents knew which parts of their day-to-day consumption were environmentally unsustainable, citing things like plastic use and driving, but they expressed frustration when they couldn\u2019t afford to change their habits.1\n\u201cI wanted to start using compostable and plastic-free products but could not afford them.\u201d\n\u201cI feel helpless when considering the impact of fossil fuel consumption. I can\u2019t help driving my car when I need to.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to buy an EV, but cannot afford it. I would also like solar panels, cannot afford those either.\u201d\nEducational campaigns can have limited or negative impact when they become constant reminders of barriers to change. Awareness of a sustainability-related problem is rarely the sole cause of inaction. Many people today understand their environmental impact and want to do something about it, but not everyone is in a position to opt into a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, paper straws, though better for the environment, are not universally accessible. Walking or taking the bus to work isn\u2019t always feasible. Meanwhile, some sustainable options can be hard to find or more expensive than the default.\nTo avoid this pitfall, highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are also cost or timesaving. Such \u201cco-benefits\u201d of climate action enable people to make the best choices for their own specific sets of circumstances. Case in point: Google Maps now shows the most fuel-efficient routes, which are often the fastest. Interest in fuel efficiency has grown globally over the past year.2 By integrating sustainability into existing products, brands can enhance people\u2019s lifestyles, rather than interrupt or criticize them. Social proof is a powerful motivator, but research shows people underestimate just how many others are taking environmental action. To remedy this, we created a website for Earth Day that highlights climate actions that have gained traction over the last few years and a variety of steps people can take toward adoption.\nWhile dramatic images of destroyed environments may emphasize the urgency of global action, they may also be overwhelming to individuals. When asked to describe \u201cactions or attitudes that could make people feel bad about their impact on the environment,\u201d many U.S. survey respondents pointed to images of landscapes ruined by trash, fires, or pollution, while some pointed to images of animal suffering.3\nDepicting the severity of an issue through poignant creative is a common way to engage people in a cause. Conveying the size of the problem with great urgency should, in theory, motivate people to act. While this may be effective for certain causes, it can sometimes be detrimental to others. Illustrating a massive phenomenon like climate change can easily overwhelm people and decrease feelings of individual efficacy.4\n\u201cI\u2019m only one person. I can\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing pictures and videos of the giant garbage pile in the ocean that is now bigger than the state of Texas ... made my stomach hurt. But I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI always feel bad when I see the changing climate\u2019s effect on animals. \u2026 I feel a little helpless.\u201d\nBrands and companies still have a place when it comes to helping people make positive changes in their daily lives. They just have to put those contributions in context. Rather than depict the harrowing consequences of inaction, focus instead on concrete, small-scale actions that add up to visible improvements. Even one-time changes that lessen impact over time \u2014 such as replacing light bulbs with LEDs \u2014 can empower customers to participate.\nConsider using before-and-after visualizations that show the value of individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 combined efforts. Time-lapse videos can illustrate outcomes in powerful ways. Such visuals show that we haven\u2019t gone past a point of no return and that measures to address the problem can still be effective. Reporting an initiative\u2019s success to date can also make people want to be a part of the solution.\nPeople may react negatively to being told what to do by brands. This type of purpose-driven advertising can be met with skepticism, with some viewing it as greenwashing. Many U.S. survey respondents pointed to insufficient evidence as a barrier to believing a company\u2019s sustainability claims.5\n\u201cMost of the time [sustainable messaging] is just greenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they can show proof [of] what they\u2019re doing to protect the environment, I don\u2019t fully believe it.\u201d\nThe sentiments align with results from a global survey of top-level executives that had nearly 6 out of 10 (59%) admitting to overstating \u2014 or inaccurately representing \u2014 their sustainability activities. Reporting hard metrics can be an effective inoculation against exaggeration. If you are able to substantiate the value of your offerings, those who care about the cause might consider your proposition. At the very least, they might do some research on their end to learn more about your brand and its climate action goals.\nEffective sustainability marketing and messaging is all about delivering reliable information to help people make better choices in the context of their lives. It\u2019s also about unearthing essential data so that people can gauge and compare the impact of different offerings. For retailers, this might mean introducing features that highlight brands carrying Energy Star-certified products, allowing shoppers to filter for energy-efficient options with a single click.\nThe climate crisis is an urgent matter and individual changes to our lifestyles and behavior have an impact. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve \u201cglobal net-zero\u201d by 2050 are linked to consumer choices.6\nWhile businesses and governments have an opportunity to lead the charge, they also have a critical role to play in making sustainable living more accessible and inclusive for all \u2014 by considering the multifaceted lives of customers who are already well aware of the changes they want to make."

Studying video production in high school led me to make so many short films for the Y that they hired me as a freelancer. Local projects like these gave me more visibility and credibility in my community as a video producer. A friend helped me land my first gig with a Fortune 500 brand as a video producer for the Raurfest music festival. The success of the festival led to a meeting with executives at festival sponsor Coca-Cola to talk about my vision for future projects.\nAfter scaling productions early in Atlanta, I started studying film and entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. By my sophomore year, I had traveled the country working on creative projects with major brands, like Puma, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Land Rover, juggling high-profile projects with being a full-time student, finding a job, and building my personal brand as a freelance content creator. It was overwhelming, but I soon realized I was not alone. Many talented students wanted to build their portfolios and monetize their craft. They just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nI saw an opportunity to simplify the gig-finding and on-ramping processes so that young creators could turn their hobbies and passions into careers. From working with marketers, I knew that giving brands a way to discover and manage creator partnerships in one place could be game-changing. That\u2019s what led me to launch Cllctve, a portfolio platform that connects creators with their next opportunity and helps brands easily find and connect with Gen Z voices.\nThe content landscape is changing rapidly, and streaming is at the forefront. Digital video content is much more accessible to consumers, with a range of video lengths, types of content, and production quality. Over the past five years, there\u2019s been a significant rise in digital video-on-demand content as more consumers become creators of content as well. The more tools platforms give people to express themselves, the more content people will create, including branded content. Platforms like YouTube exemplify the cyclical relationship between consuming and creating content.\nThis is the age of the creator economy. At Cllctve, we believe that every human is a creator. We imagine a future where everyone has access to the tools, resources, and network to create the life they want. While many monetization avenues continue to grow, 77% of creators still depend on brand deals for revenue. And brands are looking for talent to help them produce their next campaigns.\nHistorically, Black creators have been among the leading spheres of influence driving the content economy forward. Whether it\u2019s through the storytelling of legendary writers like Toni Morrison, the choreography of revolutionary artists like Alvin Ailey, or the countless innovators of collective movements across genre and craft, Black creators have always achieved their creative visions by using their gifts to create through media that reaches the masses. 2015 proved to be a tipping point, when consumer data caught up to producer impact, and the results showed the influence of Black creators on the content landscape in real time. Black people are also some of the fastest to adopt streaming services. To move into representation beyond Black History Month, brands need to expand the types of Black talent they feature, pay Black creators equitably, and credit them for their contributions.\nBrands need to scout early and often for Black talent, expanding their search to places and people that are often overlooked. The increase in creator-economy activity nationwide gives brands the opportunity to look outside the traditional markets of New York and Los Angeles for talent. Given that the media has the potential to influence so much of how we see ourselves, brands need to expand representation beyond celebrities to emerging creators who deserve to be known. While it can feel more comfortable to reach out to the same circles, it\u2019s important for marketing teams to go beyond the usual roster to find young, diverse talent. Cllctve helps them find this talent by giving Gen Z creators a way to be discovered by brands trying to connect authentically with young audiences. One of the creators on our platform is based in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been able to work with local and national brands to produce content for them remotely, while staying close to his family.\nCompensation is a critical part of hiring the best talent, yet it\u2019s too often overlooked. The creator-economy wage gap between Black and white workers is disheartening, at 35%. This shows that when brands do decide to hire Black creators, it\u2019s at a significantly lower price point than their white counterparts. Even though the data shows that Black viewership is a leading driver of growth, the value these companies choose to invest in Black creators betrays a willingness to profit from Black art while underpaying Black artists.\nThe key to closing this gap is transparency. At Cllctve, we talk openly about how creators can think about pricing, and we encourage our creators to post their rates on their profile so there are no surprises when they connect with brands. We also provide prompts to help both brands and creators start the conversation. It\u2019s important to me that creators have the tools and resources that they need to feel empowered, and that brands know as much information upfront to streamline conversations. That way, everyone gets value out of the partnership.\nFinancial compensation is important, but so is crediting and celebrating Black creatives. Giving credit can look different depending on the project. Often it means using your platform to elevate Black creativity. One brand that actively seeks to credit both Black creators and Black businesses is Target. In a recent series called Convos with CEOs, Target partnered with YouTube Creator Hallease to highlight the stories behind the CEOs of four different Black-owned brands at Target. With over an hour of original content, the campaign garnered 6.4 million views, 20% higher than benchmarks.\nWhile it\u2019s great to use February as a time to prioritize these initiatives, investing in broad and systemic representation of creators should be a year-round effort. To make good on promises to drive equity, brands must embed it into the DNA of their businesses. And that means scouting, paying, and crediting Black creators."

        "output": "Brands are embracing multiformat video as a key marketing strategy, whether they\u2019re exploring how personal relevance influences watching habits across formats or thinking like creators and experimenting with short- and long-form content. And with 80% of viewers agreeing that YouTube offers the largest variety of video content compared to any other platform,1 brands are turning to the platform to bring their campaigns to life across different formats and environments.\nSource: Google/Kantar, U.S., YouTube U.S. Hero Claims 2022, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop viewers of video content min. once/week, fieldwork completed in Q1 2022.\nWhile multiformat success often means matching your creative asset with the right screen and content type, it\u2019s also critically important to use video formats that are geared toward your marketing goals. Here, we\u2019ll break down what this means in practice by looking at three case studies about brands that combined multiple video formats with cutting-edge creative to drive powerful results.\nNissan wanted to build awareness and excitement for its all-new, all-electric vehicle, Ariya, in a thrilling way. Knowing that music offers a deeply personal, yet universal, experience, the brand dreamed up unique ways to leverage the art form. Since YouTube offers a breadth of ways for music fans to tap into their passions, the marketing team tapped into the platform to reach engaged audiences.\nTo fully demonstrate Ariya\u2019s duality \u2014 that of a serene, Japanese-inspired cabin combined with the thrilling torque of an electric vehicle \u2014 Nissan opted to experiment with YouTube\u2019s popular lo-fi trend, consisting of music videos with chill hip-hop beats and stripped-back production.\nInspired by a popular creator called Lofi Girl, Nissan created its own four-hour lo-fi video, complete with a 15-track playlist and whimsical animation. While creating hourslong content might be considered risky, Nissan felt confident that YouTube viewers would be receptive. As Allyson Witherspoon, Nissan\u2019s global CMO, explains, \u201cIn launching the all-electric Ariya, we looked to build awareness and consideration in ways that could match the vehicle in being exceptionally creative, unique, and trend-leading. That\u2019s where YouTube came in. It gave us the creative canvas to innovate and authentically connect with our audience.\u201d\nNissan ran its lo-fi video across screens using skippable in-stream ads to drive efficient reach, along with a roadblock on Lofi Girl\u2019s channel to increase the video\u2019s share of voice. The team also used a diverse mix of music lineups to surround the campaign with related content, engage new audiences, and meet passionate music lovers already primed for listening across screens.\nIn its first month, the video drew over 7 million views and thousands of positive comments. It earned an impressive average watch time of 15 minutes across all devices, and 19 minutes on connected TV (CTV) specifically. The campaign\u2019s impact proves that with the right creative, the right trend, and the right platform, even the longest-form content can engage audiences across screens.\nInternational fitness brand Les Mills had the goal of increasing sign ups for its Les Mills+ at-home fitness app. To achieve it, the brand sought to make exercise \u2014 an intimidating concept for many consumers \u2014 feel more accessible. This made short, made-for-mobile video the ideal format. And, with YouTube Shorts averaging over 50 billion daily views (as of January 2023),2 Les Mills put Shorts at the center of its plan.\nFor ad creative, the brand repurposed short-form, vertical video content previously developed for social media. Next, the Les Mills team ran a mix of vertical and horizontal Video action campaigns to encourage lower-funnel audiences to sign up for the Les Mills+ app. This approach ensured that viewers would receive the most suitable aspect ratio, regardless of device.\nUltimately, the campaign exceeded expectations by generating a 52% increase in click-through rate, while reducing cost; Les Mills saw a 10% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 16% decrease in cost per impression. And, while people tuned in on a variety of devices, 24% of impressions were generated from views on mobile phones, supporting the team\u2019s strategy to build with mobile in mind.\nAs Michael Fitzpatrick, marketing manager at Les Mills, explains, \u201cIncorporating vertical video has enabled us to reach incremental audiences during their different watch states and, ultimately, drive more people to work out with us on Les Mills+.\u201d His team\u2019s successful approach shows that using multiple formats helps marketers meet customers where they\u2019re consuming content and drive the results they seek.\nFor centuries, winery brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has been known for its prestigious, high-end Champagne. More recently, however, the company has sought to increase brand desirability by expanding its core audience. For the marketing team, this meant a rejuvenation of brand content, with a modern twist. Taking a cue from the popular how-to trend on YouTube, they created The Perfect Serve, a tutorial series aimed at making Champagne culture appeal to a new generation.\nThis series included long-form videos, along with shorter, bite-sized teaser videos. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s creative best practices, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon designed its shorter videos to run as attention-grabbing in-stream ads to attract viewers to its \u201cThe Perfect Serve\u201d YouTube playlist.\nWith creative assets ready, the team considered screens. Since reaching people in multiple watching environments was important, they made a bold choice to run two different campaigns; one meant for viewers specifically streaming YouTube on their CTVs and another that focused on all other devices.\nWhile the two campaigns used the same creative assets, the CTV campaign helped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon marry its engaging tutorials with a screen designed to be immersive and proved to be effective. According to our recent study with Latitude, viewers agree that ads on YouTube CTV are more relevant (59%), unique (55%), informative (52%), and enjoyable (51%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3\nBoth campaigns performed exceptionally well, but the CTV effort was the most successful with viewers. Compared to the campaign targeting other devices, it drove more than double the ad recall, demonstrating how brands can use CTV to bolster their media strategies and connect with passionate audiences.\n\u201cThe emergence of CTV on YouTube shows us how message and format are intrinsically linked,\u2019\u2019 says Karen Valesella, digital marketing and communications director at Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u2018\u2019Whether it\u2019s very short or very long formats, YouTube offers us a wide range of possibilities to meet all our needs.\u201d Citing its impressive results, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has incorporated CTV into the brand\u2019s broader strategy.\nNissan took a chance on a four-hour lo-fi video to drive excitement for its electric vehicle, while Les Mills successfully increased sign-ups with short-form fitness content. And Mo\u00ebt & Chandon experimented with different formats to boost their brand appeal, ultimately striking gold with their CTV campaign. These campaigns proved how multiformat videos on YouTube can help brands tell their stories and reach the world\u2019s largest video-viewing audience at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way."

        "output": "YouTube is the top streaming destination for viewers of all generations. Senior leaders from media agency Carat share how brands should approach the platform to connect with audiences and drive results.\nAs people of all generations spend less time watching TV1 and more time online,2 it\u2019s increasingly clear that YouTube is now their top choice among streaming and social platforms.3\nViewers come to YouTube for many reasons: to immerse themselves in their favorite worlds through deep-dive content, to catch a new video from their favorite creator, or to find in-depth commentary and analysis. A top reason audiences tune into the No. 1 most-watched streaming platform in America4 is to rewind relevant events5 and discover thoughtful perspectives in a media environment that sometimes sacrifices depth for velocity. This is according to recent research on viewer trends from media agency Carat, youth culture agency Archrival, and Google.\nThis same study demonstrated two other noteworthy insights. First, audiences appreciate having the agency to search for and choose YouTube videos that bring them joy.6 They\u2019re not just passing time watching the latest trends served up on social media. Instead, they consider the minutes and hours on YouTube to be time well spent. Second, a majority of viewers agree that creators are the reason they visit YouTube. This is especially true of Gen Z.7\nThese insights reinforce YouTube\u2019s indispensability to users and present a huge opportunity for advertisers to increase engagement with their audiences. For more on YouTube\u2019s place in viewers\u2019 lives and its significance to advertisers, we asked three agency executives from Carat to share their perspective on how brands can make the most of the unique engagement and relevance that YouTube offers.\nYouTube enables us to place people at the heart of our media approach. The platform offers powerful opportunities for brands to understand the behaviors, preferences, and cultural trends of their target audiences and then use those insights to map consumer journeys and optimize campaign performance at every stage.\nWe know, for instance, that YouTube has unparalleled influence among Gen Z viewers and that 68% of Gen Z audiences agree creators are why they keep returning to YouTube.8 This creator-driven content lets brands establish authentic connections with their audiences, inspire action, and achieve sustained growth.\nYouTube is a launchpad for myriad ideas, making it a valuable platform for brands. Users trust YouTube to provide answers and inspiration; it\u2019s the starting point and endpoint of their online experience.\nYouTube\u2019s large creator community and crowdsourcing aspects contribute to the wealth of content available and provide diverse opportunities for consumer engagement. By tapping into thoughtful perspectives, curating time well spent, and fostering creator connections, we guide brands to make the most of YouTube\u2019s unique engagement and opportunities for relevance. We ensure that brands show up where viewers have always been watching, reflecting what truly matters to them.\nPeople go to YouTube to engage with topics they are passionate about and search for different perspectives. Core users will go even deeper than casual users, journeying through the platform for a variety of opinions. YouTube is not just entertainment for them; it broadens how they see the world and think about key issues.\nYouTube\u2019s role in the media ecosystem has started to shift. As connected TV has started to feel more traditional and social media has become unpredictable, YouTube now seems to sit in a sweet spot between the two. YouTube offers users more control and searchability than social platforms, but the content still feels fresh, unconstrained by the rigid formats associated with TV. Brands should lean into these strengths. By doing so, they can still drive reach within topics of interest, maintain the freedom to play with format, and offer unique perspectives audiences can\u2019t get elsewhere."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The final weeks of the year provide a natural opportunity to reflect on the world around us and plan for the future. As 2021 has been another year of change driven by disruptive external events, the year\u2019s top videos \u2014 viewed by 2 billion people across more than 100 countries \u2014 reflect that reality.\nYouTube\u2019s Culture and Trends team reviewed the top videos from creators from around the globe and saw three themes emerge \u2014 community, comfort, and creativity \u2014 that offer a glimpse into what people are watching and what 2022 might hold. Together these themes not only encapsulate where we are today, but speak to broader shifts in society. From a marketing standpoint, these global insights can help brands understand what people are looking for and how best to reach them.\n\u201cGaming\u201d used to be a subculture, but with 2.9 billion people expected to play video games by the end of this year, today it\u2019s clearly pop culture. The $175 billion industry also has a diverse consumer base, with women making up 46% of gamers and 10% of gamers identifying as LGBTQ+.\nGaming\u2019s primacy is reflected in this year\u2019s Top 10 lists. Players from around the world have taken gaming to the next level, using game elements to craft narratives that spark viewer obsession akin to a must-see TV series. YouTube\u2019s most viewed game, \u201cMinecraft,\u201d featured prominently in two of the top trending videos, receiving more than 100 million combined views. YouTube\u2019s most viewed new game, a rhythm game called \u201cFriday Night Funkin\u201d that\u2019s reminiscent of early 2000s craze \u201cDance Dance Revolution,\u201d made the list with an entry from Cory Kenshin. And speaking of nostalgia, another dominant video, Game Night Stereotypes from top creators Dude Perfect, hilariously portrays a cast of characters often encountered playing board games.\nSource: Newzoo, Global Games Market to Generate $175.8 Billion in 2021; Despite a Slight Decline, the Market Is on Track to Surpass $200 Billion in 2023, May 6, 2021.\nFor many creators and viewers, engaging with game content offers a way to engage with each other, whether through live streaming or on their own time. With the huge cultural zeitgeist around gaming, marketers are finding creative ways to tap into this community. Nintendo debuted its new OLED model, highlighting different games and ways to play, earning a spot on the 2021 end-of-year YouTube ads leaderboard. Among other brand integrations, Balenciaga collaborated with Fortnite, Lil Nas X performed for Roblox, and Puma and ColourPop partnered with Animal Crossing.\nThe past two years have been defined by global political and social instability with little ability to guess the future beyond next week. Perhaps in response to this extended period of uncertainty, people around the world engaged in comfort viewing by seeking out the familiar.\nFor instance, some of this year\u2019s top trending videos from around the world are newer versions of videos that previously resonated with viewers. Back by popular demand, Sidemen created a third installment of their \u201cTinder in Real Life\u201d series, while Mark Rober reprised his 2020 backyard squirrel maze with an even more challenging obstacle course.\nJust as familiar content brings a sense of comfort, so does comedy. Many of 2021\u2019s most popular comedy videos centered on relatable, true-to-life events. This video from Canadian creator Jeenie.Weenie, one in a series about her experience as a flight attendant dealing with different types of passengers, has more than 8 million views.\nOther top videos provided a comic twist on the journalistic interview format. Two students interviewed German rapper Shirin David about her lyrics, and U.K. creator Niko Omilana cleverly convinced BBC News to interview him, while also encouraging people to vote. Taking note of the types of content people are engaging with and looking for \u2014 both comfort and comedy \u2014 can help marketers meet consumers where they are with messages that resonate, which is important in times of uncertainty.\nWhereas audiences have embraced long-form videos on familiar themes, short-form video has become a laboratory for new storytelling formats. Hybrid creators who produce YouTube Shorts alongside their long-form videos have illustrated how quick bites can give audiences a novel experience. Chef Nick DiGiovanni\u2019s long-form videos resemble the food content trend that dominated the first 20 years of this century. But his short-form recipes rely on a quirkier, more playful editing style. By creating for both formats, Nick can bake his cake and eat it too.\nSome creators \u2014 like Chingu amiga, a Korean woman living in Mexico \u2014 use short-form videos to highlight cultural nuances. And others share motivational messages and interesting facts. We see this with Indian creator A2 Motivation, whose bite-sized videos and channel have collectively garnered over 6 billion views. By giving us another view of their worlds, Shorts offer an expanded way for creators to connect with audiences.\nFor marketers, sometimes short and sweet works well, whether that\u2019s giving people a look behind the scenes or demonstrating a new way to use your product. Japanese restaurant Horumon Shimata went viral with a warning video showing that dangerously hot car temperatures are capable of cooking raw meat. The brand regularly posts behind-the-scenes food videos that subtly promote the restaurant to diners.\nAs we reflected on 2021, themes of community, comfort, and creativity popped up repeatedly in the videos YouTubers around the world chose to watch. These are not fleeting trends, but broader indicators of the kinds of content consumers need and the creators they love. Marketers who embrace these themes in their video and ad creative will evolve with their viewers and connect with key audiences in the moments that matter."

        "input": "",
        "output": "David Mataranglo is the U.S. CEO at Reprise Digital, a performance marketing company. Here, he shares how to create an agile business that\u2019s ready to tackle today\u2019s challenges and be prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow by focusing your marketing on customer behaviors.\nClosing out this calendar year, businesses are likely realizing that uncertainty is the only certainty. A parade of headlines \u2014 covering labor shortages, supply chain delays, inflation, and uncertain financial markets \u2014 dominate the news and suggest that volatility will persist. As a result, changes in consumer behavior will likely continue, sending a clear signal to brands: Adapt or be left behind.\nAt Reprise Digital, we help ensure that the brands we work with are agile and ready for whatever the future holds. We do this by focusing on how consumers move along the path to purchase, and analyzing and assessing those behaviors holistically, rather than in siloed channels. This approach allows brands to design their marketing around consumer behaviors, which positions them to thrive, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nA great example of this is the work we\u2019ve done with dermocosmetic skin care brand NEOSTRATA and its e-commerce strategy.\nOperating a direct-to-consumer business model, the company sought to efficiently drive traffic and online sales despite having limited awareness. In partnership with Reprise, NEOSTRATA piloted a new approach using Performance Max, which leverages automation to optimize Google and YouTube campaigns in real time. More specifically, this helped the brand hit its predetermined goals by identifying the right ad creative and the right ad placement to reach the customers most likely to convert.\nThe campaign\u2019s results speak for themselves: When comparing three months of Performance Max data to the previous three months of standard Shopping campaigns, NEOSTRATA saw a 91% increase in revenue at a 65% increase in spend, all while increasing efficiency 16%.\nWhile every brand is unique and will see different results, you can follow this example \u2014 and deliver consumer-centric marketing while staying agile \u2014 by employing three key steps. First, enhance your first-party data strategy. Then use automation to optimize your marketing for the right customers. And finally, build a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience.\nAs the economy tightens, many brands are tempted to shift their advertising focus to performance and results. With increased scrutiny on ROI, marketing teams will need to work smarter, using data to achieve greater scale and better outcomes without sacrificing effectiveness. This requires having a sustainable first-party data strategy in place.\nFirst-party data can create new value for your marketing, improve ad performance, and help you deepen relationships with your customers. To build a strong strategy, it\u2019s critical to know exactly what data you need to collect from customers and have a clear plan for how it will be used. For example, NEOSTRATA identified its website visitors, particularly those who did not make a purchase, as a crucial audience to help drive the highest quality leads.\nAs you develop your strategy, keep in mind that value exchange is paramount. You must give your customers something of value in return for their consented data, such as early access to new product launches, personalized recommendations, exclusive products, and other unique offers.\nIn times of volatility, brands should shift their focus away from generalized outcomes, like the number of clicks, toward customers who are the most valuable and profitable. And because customer journeys are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to measure, leveraging automation is increasingly important.\nWith automation, it\u2019s possible to focus your campaign reach on those online customers who are most likely to shop with your brand. Tools like Performance Max, for instance, allow you to promote products across a range of channels, and ensure that you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. This capability becomes even more powerful when you\u2019re able to combine it with first-party data you\u2019ve collected and build lists of people who may be interested in your products.\nAutomation becomes even more significant when you factor in nuances like fluctuating demand across markets, because it can keep pace with shifting consumer behavior faster than a manual, human-led process. In this way, automation can be a particularly vital device for keeping your business agile and ready to react to changes in real time.\nWe certainly saw this with NEOSTRATA. Using Performance Max, the marketing team was able to optimize their Google Shopping feed, regularly rotate ad copy and collateral, and develop a complete set of audience signals, like website visitors and purchases used to target new customers. And all of this was done at scale and across new formats like video, which is crucial for driving conversions across a full-funnel strategy.\nIncreasingly, brands need to think beyond in-store versus online, linear versus digital marketing, or mid-funnel versus lower-funnel conversions and embrace a more connected, omnichannel customer experience. Indeed, a recent survey by McKinsey found that 75% of U.S. consumers say they\u2019re going both online and into stores to research and buy products across categories.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? A fully connected customer experience collapses the traditional marketing funnel and authentically reflects how people are actually shopping today. For example, people increasingly use the internet to discover new products and often end up buying products immediately after researching them. So what has traditionally been an upper-funnel activity is now also a purchasing opportunity through various shoppable media. This means that every connection you make is a chance to acquire a new customer.\nDuring the past couple of years, NEOSTRATA focused on expanding their approach from selling products mainly in dermatology offices to selling directly to consumers. That meant the brand needed to create experiences that make it easier for customers to convert throughout the funnel, whether they were comparing different skin care products through Search or discovering the brand for the first time on YouTube. In fact, combining search and video is especially important, as research shows that YouTube advertisers see brand videos driving 28% of their conversion assists.1\nAmid a volatile economic forecast, it\u2019s more important than ever for your businesses to adapt and stay agile. You can set yourself up for success by developing a smart first-party data strategy, leveraging automation to find the most valuable customers and creating a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience. With these tactics, your business can drive growth now and capitalize on new opportunities in the future."

        "output": "A version of this article first appeared on the YouTube Blog on February 27, 2023.\nEquity and inclusion are at the forefront of YouTube\u2019s mission. Upholding it means that our teams are constantly exploring how our norms, practices, and policies may inadvertently create bias and inequity on the platform.\nThis is why, in 2020, we established a dedicated Racial Justice, Equity, and Product Inclusion team to ensure that the voices of historically underrepresented communities were incorporated early into the development of our products and protocols. Since then, one of the team\u2019s core programs \u2014 called the Inclusion Working Group (IWG) \u2014 has played a critical role in embedding equity into YouTube\u2019s platform and business.\nWe created the IWG as a resource to help our employees consider key risks and opportunities during the development of new products, processes, and policies. It consists of a dedicated product inclusion lead, executive sponsors, employee resource group (ERG) representatives, and leaders from across YouTube \u2014 including experts in machine learning and responsible AI.\nWhile we have a long way to go, the IWG has been a significant step forward in YouTube\u2019s commitment to driving equality. We also acknowledge the power of sharing our progress, with the hope that it can help inspire others to tackle inequality with us, together.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re eager to share three key things that have helped the IWG succeed.\nBeing user first is core to everything we do at YouTube, and it\u2019s imperative that our users see themselves and their lived experiences reflected in our products and policies.\nDelivering on this requires teams to consider equity and inclusion early and often in the development process, so they have time to identify and mitigate risks, and adjust direction when necessary. The IWG makes this possible.\nThe group partners directly with teams to understand how they plan to use machine learning, whether facets of identity are considered in their products, whether new launches may lead to undue hate and harassment, and more.\nAlready, we\u2019ve seen the IWG\u2019s contributions help teams improve a range of projects and programs. For example, it directly influenced the creation of new safety protocols for the first-ever all-female broadcast of a Major League Baseball game last summer. The IWG also helped improve how we detect racially insensitive comments on YouTube, prepared our teams to better identify and respond to new forms of online hate, and provided constant advocacy for the safety and diverse representation of Creators in product launches.\nBy design, the IWG gets its strength from its members \u2014 a consultative, cross-functional team of professionals that span YouTube\u2019s product areas, varied ERGs, and its executive leadership.\nIn addition to its members\u2019 vast expertise and experience, executive sponsorship and buy-in are essential to formalize and champion the IWG\u2019s role. The group helps to mitigate risk and improve the overall quality of product launches by assembling voices from across multiple functions and underrepresented groups to consider questions of inclusion.\nTo date, the IWG has partnered with YouTube teams on over 900 projects. In 2023, the program will expand its coverage to 100% of YouTube\u2019s product teams and range of collaborators. It will also provide guidance on how to prioritize equity across product strategy and to increase visibility among teams. Additionally, the IWG will focus on educating teams by sharing learnings from case studies, research, frameworks, and other content to continue driving scalable ways of thinking equity-first.\nWhile this work will take time and thoughtful discussion, we are motivated by the ways it will benefit the entire YouTube ecosystem for years to come. We acknowledge there is much to do and look forward to sharing more of our progress as we continue this work."

        "output": "Flying cars may have been a sign of the times on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d but in real life, electric vehicles (EVs) are ushering us into the future. Just as gas-powered engines replaced horse-drawn carts a century ago, EVs are disrupting the industry and setting the standard for the next hundred years of auto innovation.\nIn short, EVs are taking over. EV sales in the U.S. rose 62% in the first half of this year, and now make up 5% of new car sales. While this may sound small, it actually marks a tipping point for EV adoption. The shift to EVs could also accelerate rapidly, as drivers are still feeling squeezed by higher gas prices. In fact, searches for \u201cbest gas mileage\u201d are growing globally by 90% year over year.1 And, according to industry analysts, about 45% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.\nThese numbers have helped automakers see the EV light. They\u2019re investing over $526 billion in an all-electric future, which includes building new assembly lines and parts, learning to produce and store batteries, and preparing for changing tax implications.\nBut is their marketing keeping pace too? As brands work to get EVs in the hands of consumers, many auto marketers are still relying on an outdated playbook. Here are three ways they can rethink stale strategies and make their EV marketing as electric as their vehicles.\nAn avalanche of EVs is coming, leading to a crowded marketplace. The 2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Car Wars report projects that by 2026, 60% of the new models launched will be electric or hybrid.2 And more models mean more choices for auto shoppers.\nIn addition to a crowded market, automakers will also have to contend with the fact that EV models do not have the same level of brand recognition that gas-powered vehicles do. Indeed, 1 in 4 consumer searches for EVs are unbranded.3\nThis means automakers need to build brand recognition for new vehicles now to be well positioned and top of mind when EV options increase for shoppers. One way to achieve this is through video ads that can differentiate a brand\u2019s EV from the competition by touting its unique selling points. In our studies, we found that 80% of new auto purchasers took an action after watching a video,4 such as searching online for more information, visiting a dealer website, scheduling a test drive, or creating custom specifications for a new vehicle online.\nTo see how high consumer interest in EVs is, you only need to look online, where searches for EVs are accelerating. People are also looking for more detailed information about EVs, which suggests they might be heading further into the consideration phase. For example, while searches for \u201celectric vehicle\u201d have grown 87% year over year globally,5 more detailed searches like \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d have also grown by 80%.6 And searches for \u201cbest electric cars 2022\u201d have grown in the U.S. by over 5,000% year over year.7\nThis gives brands the opportunity to meet people in search results and answer their most common questions and concerns. This in turn will help brands become a major part of customers\u2019 path to purchase, guiding them every step of the way. But which search subjects should brands focus on?\nAccording to Gearshift, the most researched topics by people interested in EVs are general explorations of EV or hybrid vehicles, vehicle charging information, maintenance, and environmental benefits.8 And notably, the top two concerns that prevent people from considering EVs are anxieties over vehicle charging or range and other technological issues.9\nPotential EV customers may be at an all-time high for consideration, but they\u2019re very unsure about making the final purchase. Most potential buyers are undecided on whether or not to buy an electric car, and most of them won\u2019t end up converting.10 In the end, just 33% of new U.S. car buyers who considered a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle bought one.11\nApproaching hesitant buyers with outdated marketing tactics and a one-size-fits-all message probably won\u2019t make much of a dent, especially since the EV market is evolving so rapidly. Brands must be able to zig as customers zag and deliver tailored messaging to varying customer segments with different needs and concerns.\nTo do this at scale, brands should use automation and machine learning to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time. The real-time data from automated campaigns can also help brands learn more about potential customers and easily tweak their messaging to increase its effectiveness. By using these modern marketing tools, brands can convince hesitant buyers to choose a vehicle of the future.\nAs consideration and sales of EVs rapidly increase, automakers can set themselves up for success by using video to differentiate their brand and EV models from the competition, appearing in EV search results to answer customer questions, and leveraging automation to deliver the right message to a wide range of consumers.

Here is some key points.\n- Booking.com has introduced the Travel Proud program to make travel safer and more enjoyable for LGBTQ+ travelers.\n- The program includes training and certification for the hospitality industry to ensure inclusivity.\n- A survey conducted by Booking.com revealed that over half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had unwelcoming experiences while traveling.\n- The program aims to address issues such as assumptions about separate rooms for LGBTQ+ couples and the need to change behavior to avoid judgment.\n- Over 10,000 properties have already achieved the Proud Certified standard through the Travel Proud program.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Whether it\u2019s pressing the reset button or discovering new cultures, travel can be a restorative and inspiring experience. But for many LGBTQ+ travelers, it comes with underlying stresses.\nBoth during the planning stage and on the trip itself, they can feel forced to hide their authentic selves. Traditional booking touchpoints, such as the research phase or checking in at the chosen accommodation \u2014 which should be part of the fun \u2014 become a source of anxiety.\nAmon Versteeg, senior director of business marketing at Booking.com, knows from personal experience what this is like. So he worked closely with his team to introduce the Travel Proud program, which helps to make travel a safer, more enjoyable experience for the LGBTQ+ community.\nWith hospitality defined as \u201cthe friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers,\u201d feeling welcome is an intrinsic part of the customer experience. And when it comes to creating inclusive hospitality, Booking.com\u2019s motto is \u201cyou can\u2019t truly experience the world if you only show up as half of yourself.\u201d\nThis underscores what prompted the birth of Travel Proud \u2014 \u200b\u200ba training and certification initiative for the hospitality industry to ensure the LGBTQ+ community can travel safely and experience the full joy of travel, no matter who they love or how they identify.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ community is not accustomed to being 100% themselves. Over time and over history, we\u2019ve learned to suppress a part of who we are,\u201d Versteeg explains.\nThis means that LGBTQ+ people tend to travel with what Versteeg describes as a \u201cdetective mindset,\u201d constantly searching for clues as to whether they will truly be welcome at their chosen destination, even if it is advertised as inclusive tourism.\nVersteeg\u2019s aha! moment came when he was planning a safari with friends, and they found an incredible ecotourism site. He checked an LGBTQ+ inclusive lodging directory, found the lodge there, and excitedly told his friends.\n\u201cMy friend didn\u2019t understand why this was important, so I explained I didn\u2019t want to get to the middle of the safari and find out there would be an issue with my husband and I. My friend then said we\u2019d just have to tell them we were brothers if that happened.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s not innate to everyone to think about this. It still grounds me.\u201d\nTo better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ travelers, Booking.com conducted a survey to gauge the community\u2019s lived experiences. It revealed that more than half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had a less than welcoming travel experience.\nThis includes situations that are not necessarily intentional but can make people feel unwelcome or stressed while on vacation. For example, 20% of those surveyed had staff assume they would need separate rooms or beds when checking in as a couple, while 1 in 5 have felt the need to change their behavior \u2014 and 16% to change their appearance \u2014 to avoid judgment or awkward interactions with accommodation staff or owners.\nVersteeg\u2019s team also identified keywords and feelings from each travel touchpoint, such as researching where to stay, the actual process of booking (for example, does the property booking page use gendered or binary terms only), the arrival at the property, and their experience during their stay.\nThe results were striking. \u201cA word that repeatedly came up throughout the journey, from research through to check-in at accommodation, was \u2018caution.\u2019 And it soon became clear that \u2018safe\u2019 means \u2018good.\u2019 And at the end of the journey the emotion is \u2018relief,\u2019\u201d says Versteeg.\n\u201cFor example, when someone in our trans community is checking into accommodation, and they provide identification with a gender different to how they\u2019re presenting: This is a huge moment,\u201d Versteeg explains. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for companies to really show what welcoming looks like. Whether it\u2019s avoiding gendered pronouns or knowing that it\u2019s OK to ask what your guest prefers. That can have a huge impact.\u201d\nTravel Proud seeks to address this issue. Property owners who host on Booking.com receive coaching from Hospitable Me, which specializes in diversity and inclusion training for the hospitality industry. This training guides property owners on how they can make their venue more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ travelers, and provides tools to grow awareness and understanding. In turn, they will be featured as an inclusive destination on the Booking.com site.\nAs well as the number of venues that signed up to the program (10,000 and counting), Versteeg notes that he was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of properties that are now listed through Travel Proud, from small one-off rural destinations to major venues. \u201cIn a short time, we already surpassed 10,000 properties achieving the Proud Certified standard in our key focus markets.\u201d\nTravel Proud is a big part of Booking.com\u2019s work to deliver more authentic experiences to travelers. For LGBTQ+ travelers specifically, Versteeg states the need to challenge the meaning of what good travel means. \u201cUltimately, a good experience should be more than a safe experience. When we hold a mirror up, we ask \u2018Have we done this for everyone?\u2019\u201d\nFor other companies wishing to make similar strides, Versteeg advises starting small: \u201cFocus on understanding what would make a difference in your organization, and then turn it into many small steps. See it as a continuous journey rather than a destination.\u201d"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marketers are under strain as the economy and privacy regulations continue to shift at a rapid pace. Eighty-nine percent of marketing decision-makers agree that leadership is raising the pressure on them to demonstrate ROI, according to research that Google recently commissioned with Kantar.1\nAs a result, finding effective ways to assess how well your advertising works, while remaining privacy-conscious, is more important than ever. In this environment, how can you be confident when making decisions that set up your business for growth?\nAI-powered solutions can strengthen confidence and deliver better outcomes, all in a privacy-safe way. But to get the most from these solutions, you need to lay the groundwork and get the essentials right. By building your first-party data strategy and setting up a privacy-first digital marketing foundation, you can unlock better measurement and effectively collaborate with AI to drive business results.\nTo deliver results today and drive sustainable growth tomorrow, focus on these four key areas.\nPrivacy and performance aren\u2019t at odds. AI-powered solutions enable you to balance the two and unlock advantages for your business. This is because the predictive and analytical capabilities of AI deliver improved ROI while filling the measurement gaps created with the phaseout of third-party cookies.\nThe first step is to implement a first-party data strategy. This requires thoughtfully communicating with your customers when gathering consent about how you do and don\u2019t use their data. Research suggests that a proactive approach to privacy can give marketers a significant leg up with consumers.\nIn a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 49% of respondents said a positive privacy experience with a second-choice brand would convince them to choose that brand over a preferred brand.2\nOnce you\u2019ve built a durable foundation of first-party data, you can unlock more accurate measurement and gain a clearer view of the customer journey. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.\nThe marketing team at Calendly, a scheduling automation company, understands that a privacy-first marketing strategy is only as strong as the technologies that support it. So they built a privacy-safe measurement infrastructure that allowed them to focus on their most profitable customers.\nThrough sitewide tagging, Calendly defined the type of user that would sign up for an account and push for larger team adoption. Next, it joined the brand\u2019s online and offline data to better understand the customer journey. Within 10 months, Calendly had a full-funnel view of its highest-value prospects and customers. Furthermore, this site-tagging implementation helped the marketing team convince leadership to invest in long-term data and measurement infrastructure. As Jessica Gilmartin, CMO of Calendly, shares, \u201cby connecting Google AI to our product and customer data, we\u2019ve been able to prove the ROI of our marketing investments to our executive team. It\u2019s completely changed the game for us.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve made gains in first-party data collection, AI-powered solutions like modeling, predictive targeting, and analytics can inform your measurement strategy \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have user-level data. This fusion of innovation and privacy will help you take your business to the next level while being responsible stewards of people\u2019s data.\nPrivacy-first data collection is only the first step. A natural follow-on opportunity is to use AI-powered insights to better understand what\u2019s working well. For example, the Insights page in Google Ads uses AI to help you predict rising search trends, understand performance changes, and uncover new audiences that may not conform to your typical customer profile. Insights like these give you an alternate view of your customers\u2019 characteristics and behaviors \u2014 including ad engagements \u2014 so you can connect with them in more meaningful ways.\nSearch agency Solutions 8 used Google AI to uncover surprising insights on behalf of a food industry client. Solutions 8 ran a Performance Max campaign for its client, a producer of shelf-stable food products marketed to a particular type of customer, namely \u201cdoomsday preppers.\u201d Thanks to the Insights page in Google Ads, the agency soon learned that audiences with an interest in boating and sailing significantly outperformed the client\u2019s traditional audience. With that knowledge, it created assets for this previously unrealized customer segment and started a new campaign for the sailing audience.\nBy combining first-party data with insights, marketers can take decisive actions that lead to improved ROI and business outcomes.\nGoogle AI can help you achieve more precise campaign performance by predicting future consumer behavior and constantly optimizing to your KPIs.\nFor example, German online retailer Baur turned to Google Analytics 4 predictive audiences for a recent Google Ads campaign. By targeting an audience of likely purchasers, it achieved sales growth of 56% and an increase in conversion rate of 87%. In fact, Baur calculated that 70% of these customers could only be reached using these predictive audiences in Google Ads.\nYou can also use audience and performance data to inform AI-based solutions that maximize results over time. Take Smart Bidding, which uses Google AI to optimize your bids in every auction and increase conversions based on your goals. Using Smart Bidding, the French automobile brand Citro\u00ebn saw a 16% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) by implementing a value-based bid strategy.\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. We encourage you to adopt an iterative mindset so you can operate as confidently as possible. A spirit of experimentation will validate that your measurement and our AI powered solutions are working in a world with fewer individual identifiers.\nFor instance, advertisers who use marketing mix models (MMM) should use experiments to calibrate those models. A single experiment may be sufficient to effectively modify your MMM. When Google commissioned Nielsen to use NCSolutions\u2019 sales-lift results to calibrate its mix models, the revenue and ROAS attributed to YouTube increased 84% on average.\nThe majority of that volume was previously attributed to base variables (brand distribution and pricing), thus reallocating that volume to YouTube improved marketing results overall.\nBy directly validating what\u2019s working, you\u2019ll be able to combine your own learnings with Google AI to enable more accurate measurement and deliver results for your business.\nWe\u2019re at a critical moment in our industry. Our goal at Google is to give you confidence that your first-party data foundation, audience modeling, and measurement setup are all working hard to deliver results for you. With AI-powered tools at your fingertips, you can rest assured that you\u2019re building the most effective and cost-efficient measurement strategies possible while respecting the privacy of your customers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In preparation for the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Adrienne Hayes, Google\u2019s VP of marketing for global devices and services, spoke with Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD\u2019s president and CEO, about why LGBTQ inclusion in marketing and media is good for business. Hayes is also a GLAAD board member and serves as global executive sponsor of Google\u2019s LGBTQ employee resource group.\nIn recent years, companies have increasingly recognized the value that diverse, inclusive, and equitable marketing practices bring to their brands. For marketers, this has been deeply clarifying. Every creative choice we make has the power to shape how we see each other. Inherent in that responsibility is an incredible opportunity: to create work that positively and authentically reflects the world.\nWhile historically excluded from advertising, the LGBTQ community in the U.S. has seen positive movement toward greater inclusion and diversity in brand marketing and increasing acceptance by the general public. A report published last December by GLAAD \u2014 the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer media advocacy organization \u2014 and the Edelman Trust Institute found that Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding LGBTQ rights.\nAlong with this momentum, however, there have been plenty of setbacks. Marketers in the U.S. are likely familiar, for instance, with recent backlash experienced by one major retailer for displaying Pride Month merchandise, and the scrutiny experienced by a major brewing and beverage company after partnering with a transgender influencer. These mixed signals \u2014 rising consumer support on the one hand, push back on the other \u2014 can leave brands unsure of their own inclusive marketing plans.\nSo what does the data actually say about people\u2019s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and what should brands be doing \u2014 with confidence \u2014 to honor their inclusive marketing commitments?\nGLAAD recently released two studies that can be instructive. Its ninth annual Accelerating Acceptance study, which examines acceptance and attitudes toward LGBTQ Americans, showed that a record number of non-LGBTQ Americans support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. Support is quite literally at an all-time high. But an analysis of representation in advertising tells a different story.\nThis month, GLAAD\u2019s Advertising Visibility Index \u2014 an inaugural research report offering a data-backed reality check on LGBTQ representation in U.S. advertising, along with prescriptive guidance for brands \u2014 indicated that the LGBTQ community\u2019s size is not accurately reflected in ads and that current methods of inclusion are not always apparent to consumers. The takeaway is that there is room for improvement for the vast majority of brands.\nRecently, I sat down with Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO at GLAAD, to discuss the two studies and identify actions that marketers can take today to make their marketing more inclusive.\nSarah Kate Ellis: Our findings are really significant for marketers. For instance, we found that 3 out of 4 non-LGBTQ adults feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, which seems to validate that the backlash to inclusive ad campaigns really is coming from a small, though loud, number of activists. Inclusion is not only good for the bottom line, but when consumers are exposed to LGBTQ people and their lives in the media, that exposure has a profound impact on shifting culture and changing sentiments. Sixty percent of non-LGBTQ adults agree that seeing LGBTQ people in ads make them more comfortable with people who are different than themselves.1 So inclusion actually creates a more accepting society.\nEllis: Yes. We\u2019ve seen influencers and celebrities increasingly used in brand advertising, in general, and over 70% of inclusive ads we studied featured LGBTQ celebrities.2 But here\u2019s what is interesting: When it comes to LGBTQ representation, inclusion of an LGBTQ celebrity is the least important factor for consumers, LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ. What they\u2019re actually looking for are displays of empathy and humanity, followed by realistic storylines, like families sharing meals or couples holding hands.3 People want to see the everyday, human stuff. It\u2019s realistic stories over celebrity endorsement.\nEllis: While it\u2019s distressingly loud, it\u2019s actually far from the norm. Only 17% of consumers say seeing LGBTQ representation in brand advertising would make them feel more negatively about a brand. And only 16% of consumers say they would be less likely to purchase that brand\u2019s products or services.4 At a time when 1 in 5 Gen Zers in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, the calls for inclusion will continue to grow and be louder than the critics.\nSo negativity exists, but it\u2019s a really small portion of people who feel that way. Inclusive marketing is everywhere, and just because a few brands get called out by a loud minority, does not mean that inclusive marketing will end. While the headlines focused on a few brands that tried to appease critics by changing Pride campaigns, so many other brands stood their ground and that supposed backlash faded.\nEllis: Absolutely. We posed all of these questions about LGBTQ representation, and while we know it\u2019s become both more common in some circles, it\u2019s become more contentious. But what was unexpected was that a lot of people aren\u2019t even noticing LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly two-thirds of consumers believe LGBTQ representation is explicit enough to be noticed by most people, but less than 40% of consumers noticed the representation in LGBTQ inclusive Super Bowl ads.5 So even when it\u2019s happening, people aren\u2019t always aware of it.\nEllis: Well, for starters, this is bigger than marketing. Seventy percent of non-LGBTQ consumers want companies to show public support not just in advertising but in sponsorships and hiring as well.6\nBeyond that, I think the biggest takeaway for me is the idea that representation means more than existence, more than the old \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d model. Today, it\u2019s more about being an integral part of your community. We\u2019re your neighbors and your co-workers; we\u2019re in your congregation and in your family. We\u2019re part of the fabric of society, and marketers must show that. LGBTQ people have the same desires and needs as every other American. We buy cars and laundry detergent, and we worry about our kids and our bills just like everyone else. That\u2019s the story folks in the LGBTQ community want told, and it\u2019s the story that needs to be told.\nAt Google, we\u2019re always striving to increase representation, especially during big moments, but it\u2019s imperative this remains a focus year-round. These findings are a great reminder that our work is never done and that our approach to inclusive marketing can still be improved if we want to stay relevant now and in the future. For example, my team worked on Google Pixel\u2019s Super Bowl ad this year, which featured queer artist Doja Cat. GLAAD tested this ad as part of the Advertising Index, and a majority of consumers who viewed it didn\u2019t recognize any LGBTQ inclusion. It\u2019s on us, and fellow advertisers, to seize the opportunity to tell more realistic, human LGBTQ stories."

And today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to deliver transformations that are even more profound, for both consumers and businesses.\nKristen O\u2019Hara, VP of brand and agency solutions at Google, addresses a crowd of conference goers about the AI paradigm shift.\nAs with the internet and smartphones, the emergence of AI is a critical development for businesses. But how best to strategize? Naturally, it\u2019s important that we exercise caution in the face of uncertainty to mitigate potential risk.

Advertisers using Performance Max are seeing an 18% uplift in conversions, up 5% since last year, showing just how quickly Google\u2019s AI models are advancing.3\nPerformance Max is about to get even more powerful. We recently announced we\u2019re incorporating generative AI to make it even easier for advertisers to create custom assets and scale them in a few clicks. Just provide your website, and Google AI will learn about your brand, populating your campaign with text and other relevant assets. We\u2019ll even suggest new images generated just for you, helping you stand out to customers across a wide range of inventory and formats.\nWith the power of AI, we\u2019ll discover endless possibilities for creativity through direct collaboration and experimentation. Today, AI can help you write a form letter or optimize your media mix. Tomorrow, it may overhaul your creative workflows, freeing you up to solve entirely new creative and strategic challenges.\nFor example, AI is helping The New York Times organize 7 million photos from over 100 years of reporting. Working with Google Cloud, the Times has digitized its vast photo collection, which had been stored in hundreds of filing cabinets three stories below street level in a space called the \u201cmorgue.\u201d But digitally storing the pictures is only part of the story. To make the archive accessible and useful, the Times used AI to \u201cread\u201d the images, not only by scanning text in the images and notes written on the back but by recognizing objects and places in the photographs, preserving annotations, and making the archive searchable. Now Times journalists can use this resource to report stories rooted in deep historical context.\nGenerative AI is opening up even more possibilities, and we are rapidly moving to a world where the constraints on what you can create in digital spaces are limited only by your imagination.\nWhat will this mean for all of us as marketers? For one, the gap between coming up with a great idea and deploying that idea will shrink considerably. For example, the new Product Studio tool uses generative AI to help businesses of all sizes create a range of high-quality product imagery. Product Studio can create custom product scenes for seasonal or trending opportunities, remove distracting backgrounds, or even increase the resolution and sharpness of your product photos without having to go through expensive reshoots.\nThese are powerful technologies with consequences for individuals and organizations that are still not well understood. As we move boldly toward this future of creative possibility, we must take a responsible approach. We can\u2019t see around every corner, but we can anchor to principles, respond to challenges that arise, and partner with researchers, governments, and communities to ensure we get it right.\nI\u2019ve been asking myself and my team some tough questions as we navigate this third paradigm shift. Here are a few questions you can ask as your teams figure out how to harness the power of AI."

        "input": "",
        "output": "For years, marketers have been integrating AI-powered products into nearly every aspect of their work, gaining critical insights and driving more conversions with improved campaign optimizations.\nMore recently, the profusion of news surrounding generative AI has renewed the critical importance of the human in the driver\u2019s seat, especially when it comes to building advertising creative. Commercial creative would not exist without the talent behind it, full stop. And just as marketers have been using AI-powered tools, creatives have been experimenting with AI in everything from ads that talk back to concept decks that sing.\nWith responsive search ads (RSA) and responsive display ads (RDA), we\u2019ve already seen the ability of AI to optimize thoughtfully crafted assets into the best-performing combinations of creative. We know that AI can scale asset production to serve the most relevant version of an ad across channels via Performance Max, App, and Video action campaigns. Now, to get a pulse on how interdisciplinary creative teams are already exploring AI, we asked agency leads across three regions how they use it. Here\u2019s what they said.\nDuring the 2019 holiday season, a team tasked with selling the Google Nest to Australian shoppers had a unique opportunity to let people test the product from the comfort of their own homes.\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the experience of Nest into the ad itself, so that was the moonshot then \u2014 essentially, quite a while back before generative AI was a thing,\u201d said Tingyan Han, senior data strategy director, APAC at EssenceMediacom. \u201cWe needed to demonstrate the many ways in which Nest makes moments at home better.\u201d\nTo do that, the team turned to a speech-to-text API co-authored by Google with the help of the Google Nest and Google Media Lab teams.\n\u201cThere were many considerations when working with a speech-to-text API, from the UX to ad inventory and measurement, all the way down to testing whether local accents were recognizable,\u201d said Han. The ad would pause within the first few frames to allow the user time to opt in to the experience. When users said, \u201cHey Google, show me gingerbread house recipes,\u201d it would do as told.\nThe activation led to an increase in consideration to purchase. Vincent Tay, creative director, APAC at EssenceMediacom, says that\u2019s because the interactivity served to demonstrate the benefits of the product itself.\n\u201cWhile the thought of integrating new and shiny technology into every facet of our campaign can be alluring, we must always remember to place the human truth at its core,\u201d said Tay, who partnered with a UX/UR designer alongside Han on the campaign.\nMore recently, Publicis-owned Leo Burnett Australia used AI to build a talking car; Leo Burnett Taiwan used another kind of AI to celebrate Lunar New Year with potato chip-inspired fortunes.\n\u201cWe have been using Google Colab regularly for early prototyping efforts involving up-and-coming AI algorithms,\u201d said Laurent Thevenet, head of creative tech at Publicis covering APAC and MEA. \u201cWe are also starting to use Bard, as we like the fact that it is connected to the internet and can retrieve real-time information.\u201d\nIn addition to sending regular updates on emerging tech to its 4,000 creatives across the region, Publicis is also mentoring talent internally, sending mentees back to their respective agencies and teams with new knowledge.\n\u201cMachines need operators and, for the creative industry, it means that creatives will partner with machines, directing them towards the desired output,\u201d said Thevenet. \u201cThese creatives have to be hybrid talents able to think critically while having the ability to operate and connect these emerging AI systems with one another.\u201d\n\u201cImagine a concept store on the moon. What does that look like?\u201d\nEd Yeoman, creative director at London-based branding and design agency Human After All, has observed his team bringing AI into the ideation stage to collaborate on design fiction for this type of \u201cwild-card idea.\u201d\n\u201cSome people use it to get verbal prompts around language and messaging, and some people use it to get visual prompts to help them kind of imagine something that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d including events and event spaces, he said.\nGabriel Cheung, Global Executive Creative Director, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, says AI-generated content can also challenge teams to push their thinking. \u201cBecause of the way AI works with existing information, we let AI-powered tools quickly generate the \u2018first thought\u2019 ideas. Our thinking is that if AI can generate the same idea, then we haven\u2019t done our job well enough to come up with something new,\u201d said Cheung.\nGoogle recently announced a new conversational experience in Google Ads and Search campaigns that can be used to enhance brainstorms, a use case Yeoman\u2019s team found helpful.\n\u201c[The prompting] part of the process \u2026 puts you in the role of the creative or strategic director,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cOftentimes, at that level, you\u2019re helping to frame challenges for people to inspire them to do certain things. It\u2019s the same with AI. You\u2019re hoping to frame this challenge in a way which gives you an optimal output.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s announcement of the forthcoming addition of Adobe Firefly to Bard represents a commitment to ethical image generation. Firefly is trained on a catalog of hundreds of millions of licensed images in Adobe Stock. As private technology companies develop responsible AI and call for regulation, creative agencies are writing their own ethical guidelines.\n\u201cWe felt that there was a little bit of a lack of people talking about what it meant for humans,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cAt the heart of our business are the principles of empathy and reason. We try and build those into everything.\u201d\nEvery year, global creative agency Jellyfish Group invites its own technologists to a companywide hackathon. The participants invited to this year\u2019s event in Paris received a new kind of challenge: design an AI-powered solution for improving the quality and performance of creative assets. The event brought 120 technologists across data, media, and creative together to address this critical business need.\n\u201cThe benefit is huge; it elevates everyone\u2019s knowledge and experience, and that carries throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Sam Yates, chief solutions officer of creative technology at Jellyfish.\n\u201cAI has developed so fast and there\u2019s so much opportunity, but it\u2019s also kind of a wild West scenario,\u201d said Di Wu, VP of data science at Jellyfish Group. \u201cPeople are just starting to think about regulation and what it means for us to adopt AI. We created a task force around it to basically say, AI is not just about ethics; it\u2019s literally a business problem for us. If we\u2019re not using AI the right way, it could lead to bias because of the training samples used [to train the hypothetical model].\u201d Agencies will soon have access to more tools to create variations on their own work, ensuring ownability.\nWorking within established partner networks is one way to ensure safety, added Yates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stifle innovation in any way, but we do have to think about some of the risk mitigations that go with exploring new technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking closely with Google, for example, is a great opportunity for us to explore a tech stack in a safe and responsible way.\u201d\nEven before the milestones of 2023, Google had partnered with Jellyfish to design a bespoke service powered by Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Vision and Video APIs. \u201cOptics\u201d could decode which elements of an ad performed best according to a brand\u2019s goals and best practices like the YouTube ABCDs. With advances in AI, such methodologies could eventually enable teams to distinguish emotional content across ads, or even the presence of humor, to shed light on which creative choices resonated most with their brands\u2019 audiences.\nOnce teams have finalized creative assets, they can get the most out of them using smart creative formats like RSAs and RDAs. Tools like Performance Max can help make sure the right ad reaches the right audience at the right time, optimized for their chosen channels and screens. Research shows that advertisers see 2X more conversions, on average, when adding an RDA to an ad group with a static display ad.\nFrom creative testing to storyboarding, AI-powered solutions have a pivotal role to play in the future of creative development. The role itself must be defined by the needs of real creative teams, and some of the most useful applications may be found unexpectedly. Through active exploration and experimentation with AI, we can discover more concrete ways of thinking about the guardrails we want to uphold and the benefits to creative professionals they unlock."

Here is some key points.\n- Digital success in uncertain times requires leaders who can confidently change course and embrace constant change.\n- Next-generation leaders proactively operate outside traditional comfort zones and think cross-functionally.\n- Collaboration and teamwork are key to leading effectively during uncertainty.\n- C-suite alignment and support from the board of directors are critical for successful digital transformation.\n- Building and supporting an engaged board of directors is essential for future-proofing organizations.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In the final entry of our three-part series on digital transformation, Google\u2019s Courtney Rose shares how next-generation leaders deal with uncertainty. Part one focused on how organizational shifts help companies transform, and part two explored the role of a strong relationship between CMO and CFO.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent times, the only certainty companies have is uncertainty. This can be challenging for organizations who strive to be digital first, as rapid industry shifts can easily pull their focus away from continuous innovation.\nBut some companies have figured out digital success. When we recently teamed up with Kantar to study how these companies navigated dynamic markets while preparing for the future, we saw a common trait: All had leaders who could boldly face the unknown and confidently change course at a moment\u2019s notice. These leaders transformed the fabric of their organizations, cultivating open-minded, collaborative approaches that sparked innovation, and did it in the face of constant change.\nOur research underscored that this type of next-generation leadership is defined by three behaviors that other companies can implement. The first is proactively operating outside traditional comfort zones. The second involves thinking cross-functionally, and the third focuses on elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\nDuring our research, many next-generation leaders said that building a digitally savvy organization requires CxOs to work outside their comfort zones by thinking broadly about their role and the role of the C-suite, and by responding to change through teamwork and creative problem solving. Our study showed that 70% of executives from digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset, compared to 47% from digitally emerging companies.1\nThis collaborative mindset is key to leading effectively during uncertainty.2 Among the marketing executives we spoke to, 80% of those from digitally leading companies agreed that their organization\u2019s most senior marketer is open to change, compared to 64% of those from digitally emerging companies.3 And leaders who combine traditional and nontechnical skills, like adaptability and intellectual curiosity, are in a better position to develop a culture of collaboration and respond effectively to constant change, particularly when it comes to marketing initiatives.\nAs one CTO said, \u201cChange drives people nuts, but people who embrace it are the ones who can actually help us in the future.\u201d4\nAnother way next-generation leaders help their companies stay flexible during uncertain times is by developing a holistic understanding of their entire organization and encouraging cross-functional teamwork. Executives who told us that their marketing leaders proactively monitored company initiatives happening in areas outside of marketing were also 32% more likely to say their company performed much better than their competitors in revenue growth.5 When leaders think cross-functionally, they create the opportunity for marketing, finance, sales, and IT teams to understand how each group\u2019s operations impact the collective and how they can work together to drive growth and innovation.\nWe also learned that this cross-functional collaboration should extend to the leadership teams themselves. Among digitally leading companies, 70% of the CxOs we surveyed stated that support across the C-suite and the board of directors was critical to successful digital transformation. Just 46% of executives from digitally emerging companies acknowledged this level of leadership support.6\nWhen senior leaders are aligned, they can offer their separate teams a clear, unified strategic vision and shared objectives, which can serve as a North Star during volatile moments. They can also encourage greater cross-functional collaboration by removing hierarchy and helping employees further develop soft skills like communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.\nBeyond ensuring C-suite alignment and collaboration, company leaders can future-proof their organizations by building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors.\nThis starts by ensuring that the board consists of the right people. For example, 82% of marketers from digitally leading companies said their board consists of people who can play a contributing role in supporting digital transformation, while only 42% of marketers from digitally emerging companies made the same claim.7 On top of this, board members who are still active in their professions can provide valuable external perspectives, such as spotting pitfalls, challenging assumptions, and bringing fresh ideas to the table.\nNext, leadership must consider the board\u2019s role in the wider organization. CxOs should encourage the board to move away from simple business signoffs and toward engaging with the company\u2019s overarching strategy. In our study, 1 in 3 senior-level marketers said that the board should push leadership to think creatively and take meaningful risks.8 This can help ensure that the company remains focused on digital innovation during disruptive times.\nWhile business leaders can\u2019t control rapid changes in the market, they very much define how their organizations respond and whether they continue to innovate. Next-generation leaders have proven their resilience and flexibility by stepping out of their comfort zones, fostering companywide collaboration, and empowering boards of directors to take an active, valuable role in their companies\u2019 overarching operations and strategies.\nLearn more about how the next generation of leaders drive growth on the route to digital readiness."

        "input": "",
        "output": "It\u2019s no secret the media landscape has changed. This past year alone we\u2019ve seen a rise in short-form video and a breakout in AI-powered solutions. People are exposed to a wider variety of content and new ways to consume it, and one-size-fits-all campaigns are no longer enough.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners are blazing new trails by ditching the \u201cmatching luggage\u201d approach and accounting for people\u2019s unique needs. From tapping into YouTube trends to designing bespoke creative across formats, these advertisers expertly created unforgettable YouTube campaigns that resonated with audiences and drove results. Here are four lessons gleaned from the winners.\nLife insurance company MassMutual wanted to drive awareness around a bold topic: money. The brand recognized that conversations about finances are important but aren\u2019t always easy to have. It needed a creative way to grab attention and inspire people to tune into the topic. So it created a lighthearted campaign featuring diverse families having conversations about their financial futures amid unexpected events. The result was an intimate, fly-on-the-wall experience.\nMassMutual sought to make its ads unskippable by breaking the fourth wall, ingeniously utilizing the first six seconds to deliver different variations of the statement, \u201cThis is going to be extremely uncomfortable; you might want to skip this.\u201d This small-but-clever detail showed viewers that MassMutual was directly addressing them, creating a powerful connection.\nThe innovative strategy was wildly successful. In a head-to-head test, its 100% watch rate was 14 percentage points higher and costs per view (CPV) were 2X more cost efficient for creative featuring the made-for-YouTube 6-second add-on.\nSource: MassMutual Internal Data.\nLiv Lewis, EVP of EGAMI Group, praised MassMutual for their authenticity. \u201cNot only did they brilliantly embrace diversity of casting, they embraced diversity as it truly shows up in life.\u201d\nPopular blender brand BlendJet needed a campaign that could drive awareness with new customers and transform existing ones into enthusiastic brand advocates. Its strategy? Create compelling content and engage both audiences. BlendJet tapped into big YouTube trends that have stood the test of time. Assets included YouTube fan favorites such as cake or fakes, bewildering viewers with a blender disguised as a cake, and ASMR videos, soothing them with 10 hours of BlendJet assembly.\nBlendJet also mixed things up to appeal to the next generation of YouTube viewers, using the latest video trend: short form. The brand expertly integrated horizontal and vertical assets with long-form and short-form content to connect with audiences across various viewing preferences.\nReturn on advertising spend and scale allowed BlendJet to increase spend by 55% and helped drive a remarkable 66% revenue growth.\nAs Jonathan Daly, head of communications strategy at Droga5 raved, \u201cThis creative naturally utilizes the super power of YouTube as a social platform. It\u2019s designed to be highly addressable to the audience.\u201d\nOn a mission to rev up consideration, eBay Motors sought a platform that would inspire and excite audiences. That\u2019s why it raced toward YouTube, a go-to destination for inspiration. The brand teamed up with Google\u2019s Creative Works to identify trends and insights, landing on one key insight: People come to YouTube to go deep with the creators and content they love. With that in mind, eBay handed YouTube creators the keys and cocreated a masterfully produced five-part series that pitted modded cars against stock cars, with parts all purchased on eBay. Popular YouTube creator and race-car driver Collete Davis hosted each eight to 12 minute episode, featuring a special guest builder representing a subculture and product category.\nTo maximize viewership, eBay paired episode drops with paid YouTube advertising, and the results were remarkable. The brand grew its YouTube channel subscriber count from 700 to over 37,000 subscribers \u2014 606% above its goal \u2014 while generating more than 9 million views across episodes.\nSource: eBay Internal Data.\nDenise Truelove, global VP of brands at Mars Petcare, sang the team\u2019s praises. \u201cThis is a perfect example of a brand becoming entertainment.\u201d\nBeauty brand Dove also leaned into the power of long-form video to foster engagement. Over the years, Dove has fearlessly taken on the subject of real beauty to address timely issues. Recognizing how important parents\u2019 voices are in shaping children\u2019s self-esteem, the brand created nearly four-minute videos as part of its recent Dove Self-Esteem Project campaign. The videos featured face-mapping technology that put toxic advice into mothers\u2019 mouths, leaving viewers captivated.\nFor the initial push, Dove used YouTube Mastheads and in-feed video ads with a powerful thumbnail image to get people to click and watch the video. Additionally, it used video ad sequencing to prime viewers with a 15-second clip before serving the long-form version. The results spoke for themselves: 6.2 million lifted users associated Dove with raising awareness about the toxic advice girls are exposed to.\nAs Lex Beltrone, group creative director of FCB New York, put it, \u201cThis type of long-form video wouldn\u2019t feel right on any other platform but YouTube.\u201d\nBenjamin Moore, a premium paint manufacturer sold at local retailers around the world, faced a challenge. As businesses reopened and people ventured beyond their homes, home improvement took a back seat. Coupled with the economic headwinds, it was more important than ever for the company to support its local retailers. The brand took an innovative approach. It developed creative showcasing unique end cards for over 1,000 local retailers and paint colors, inspired by each region\u2019s stunning color palettes. Embracing the power of granular geotargeting, Benjamin Moore masterfully reached a small radius around a store\u2019s ZIP code in densely populated areas, while expanding reach in sparsely populated areas.\nIts colorful strategy paid off. Benjamin Moore achieved an average video completion rate of 55% across all regions, exceeding its 45% benchmark, and an impressive 30.4 million views, which was 215% over planned. With this captivating campaign, the brand flawlessly demonstrated that YouTube can help brands achieve a perfect balance of meticulous focus, expansive reach, and authentic user connection.\nSource: Benjamin Moore Internal Data.\nSimilarly, marketing automation platform Mailchimp embraced a full-funnel strategy to connect with small businesses that grapple with marketing challenges. Aiming to drive purchase intent, Mailchimp designed a whimsical campaign, featuring visuals like dancing rugs, to comically depict the confusion marketers often feel. Knowing that small business owners and decision-makers are at different stages of the funnel, it executed a highly tailored approach.\nAt the top of the funnel, it harnessed bumper ads and skippable ads, and tapped into audiences using custom affinity audience targeting to amplify brand reach. For the middle and bottom funnels, the brand shifted focus to driving engaged click volume and used Video action campaigns and audiences like custom intent. Lastly, it reached its most engaged viewers with a sign-up call to action. Moreover, Mailchimp embraced the changing landscape of how and where users watch its video content by harnessing the popularity of short-form video and updating vertical creative.\nThe highly personalized approach paid off, with a 4.2% increase in awareness and a remarkable 34% decrease in cost per paid sign-up year over year.\n\u201cThe ads helped not only empathize with the marketer\u2019s confusion but also gave them the tools and confidence to make tough marketing decisions\u201d marveled Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer and partner of Goodby Silverstein & Partners.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners showcased exceptional talent in tapping into customer needs and implementing innovative strategies to cater to diverse interests. By using the full breadth of YouTube\u2019s capabilities, these brands transformed the platform into a dynamic canvas to showcase their creativity, tell their stories, and authentically connect with their audiences."

        "input": "",
        "output": "AI is transforming marketing in profound and exciting ways. In my conversations with marketers, it\u2019s inspiring to hear how they\u2019re using AI to drive new customer connections, build high-quality creative, and make confident decisions grounded in predictive data.\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that AI can\u2019t drive marketing success by itself. AI is capable of multiplying business results and growth, but only when it\u2019s paired with human expertise. Marketers will continue to be essential in setting clear objectives \u2014 aligned to broader business goals \u2014 so that marketing impact can be accurately measured and decisions about where to invest can be more informed.\nWith that being said, the speed at which technology is evolving can leave even the most innovative marketers wondering whether their current strategies are enough to unlock AI\u2019s full potential and accelerate business growth. That\u2019s where we can help.\nFor several years at Google, we\u2019ve been building products that apply cutting-edge AI to help marketers navigate the rapidly changing landscape. In that time, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with thousands of brands and agencies to accelerate their business growth with AI, and through that experience we\u2019ve learned what works.\nHere are three key areas to prioritize for success with AI.\nA critical, often neglected aspect of AI is the causal relationship between the inputs you give to AI and the business outcomes it can generate. The fact is, AI learns from the data and experience that people provide. The higher quality the inputs, the better the results.\nMarketers who strengthen their measurement strategy and improve the quality of their audience and conversion data, for instance, can guide Google AI to better maximize their ROI. This is particularly true when consented first-party data is an input. Because it comes from direct customer relationships, the data is more durable and uniquely relevant to your business.\nRetailer H&M is a powerful example of how first-party data can be used to improve campaign performance. Last year, H&M\u2019s global head of paid media, Kristoffer Ullenius, and its global digital media analyst, Katarina Ahlner, shared more about their strategy. \u201cWhere we previously didn\u2019t optimize our paid Search campaigns towards acquiring new customers, we now started actively thinking about ways to reach them.\u201d This meant refocusing the strategy to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t buy unless they were influenced by marketing.\nH&M began by deepening its understanding of the value of each customer segment, using a customer life-cycle model rooted in first-party data. This helped the team identify frequent buyers and put less emphasis on reaching them with paid Search, to focus instead on acquiring incremental new customers. Only when customers became less active would they use Search ads to reengage shoppers.\nThis approach, coupled with a shift to a customer-focused Target ROAS bidding strategy, helped H&M grow online revenue from paid Search by more than 70% year over year. According to Ullenius and Ahlner, \u201cAs the whole business moves towards being more customer-centric, it\u2019s been rewarding to see how much impact we can make by focusing our paid efforts on value.\u201d\nWith high-quality data in place, the next key focus area is using AI-powered campaigns to optimize your performance in real time. Every day, we\u2019re seeing that marketers who leverage Google AI can deliver more conversions and get more value out of their campaigns.\nPerformance Max, for example, is a goal-based campaign type that helps advertisers find untapped and incremental opportunities. Advertisers share their campaign goals and creative assets, and our technology automatically produces and runs a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google\u2019s channels.\nSamsung recently put Performance Max to the test across multiple markets to find untapped consumer demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\nAccording to Sandeep Bajpai, director and head of direct-to-consumer marketing at Samsung India, \u201cThe results were phenomenal. With AI-powered campaigns, we doubled our revenue without affecting our return on advertising spend too much.\u201d\nThe final area to prioritize is as critical as data and technology but wholly reliant on people. To get the most out of AI, you need a shared mindset that\u2019s anchored in experimentation and agility.\nIn a recent report created by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, in association with Google, industry leaders shared guidance on how to maximize AI as a business multiplier. Many of them emphasized the importance of a test, learn, and scale mindset, where your team can fail fast but learn quickly which new approaches can unlock profitable growth.\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, explained, \u201cTo protect profitability, experimentation should happen within a controlled environment. Cross-functional teams will need to nurture a test-and-learn culture where leaders can quickly adjust the plan when results don\u2019t come in as expected, or double down on what works.\u201d\nWhile AI solutions may be perceived as disruptive, they can be approached in a gradual manner. Embracing a culture of experimentation is a critical factor for organizations trying to reap the full benefits of AI.\nFor example, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica spent considerable time thoroughly testing AI-powered campaigns and analyzing the business impact of changes to bidding automation, campaign structure, and feed management. According to global performance marketing director Andrea Orlunghi, \u201cTesting new solutions allowed us to create a shared definition of success that spanned across departments.\u201d And its success was tangible. \u201cIn the past two years, combining a wide range of Google AI solutions contributed to nearly a 50% growth in the global online business of EssilorLuxottica.\u201d\nFostering agility by balancing early plans with an ability to pivot is equally important, especially in the context of planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels.\nFor many companies, however, quickly shifting budgets to the biggest opportunities isn\u2019t easy. This is typically due to traditional silos in media channels that carried over to budgets and organizational structures. Unfortunately, these silos can be kryptonite for AI, limiting its ability to optimize and maximize performance.\nBy evolving your multichannel approach to be nimble enough to respond to consumer demands, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to capture incremental performance opportunities as they emerge. This process can be further bolstered by directly aligning marketing KPIs with business goals and partnering with your executive leadership to accurately quantify marketing\u2019s contribution based on key financial metrics. Research shows the results are worth it: Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.1\nIn sharing these AI essentials, it\u2019s my hope that you feel equipped to act today in ways that strengthen your marketing and accelerate business growth for years to come.

        "output": "Kendall Kazor is a member of Google\u2019s People Development School for Googlers team, which produces Resilience at Google, a podcast examining the science behind resilience and high performance. This excerpted interview features a conversation from Season 2.\nCreativity can be hard to define, but it\u2019s an essential skill in today\u2019s workforce. Creativity helps us solve existing challenges and envision new opportunities, and it is considered an X-factor by many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies.\nAs the pace of work and connectivity steadily increases, how do we create the space we need to come up with our best ideas? Can we be creative and productive at the same time? And how do we keep the creative spark lit, even when we start to feel drained? These are questions we hear often from Googlers, but they are not questions unique to Google.\nIn April of this year, we launched a podcast series to help people better understand resilience, which we define as the ability to respond to and recover from stress. Every episode pairs neuroscientists and psychologists with mental performance coaches who discuss the science behind resilience, along with effective ways to react to change and other daily challenges.\nIn the first episode of the podcast\u2019s second season, we focus on creativity \u2014 specifically, how to recharge ourselves and maximize creativity during periods of high stress and transition. For this conversation, we were joined by digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush and associate professor of sport and performance psychology at Nottingham Trent University Dr. Mustafa Sarkar.\nWe\u2019re all striving to be our best, and often we equate that with being productive. Rahaf, you wrote a book called \u201cHustle and Float,\u201d which is a helpful concept for thinking about productivity. Can you explain it?\nRahaf Harfoush: \u201cHustle and float\u201d is a phrase borrowed from white-water rafting. It\u2019s the idea that, to have a good rafting trip, you need a mix of hustle and float. There\u2019s a period when you have to exert yourself to make the raft go where you want it to go, to move forward. But there are also periods when you have to lift your oar and let the river do the work. Too much of one or the other will ruin your trip. Too much hustle, and you\u2019ll get exhausted and make mistakes that can be dangerous. Too much float, and it\u2019s boring; you don\u2019t get where you want to go and are at the mercy of the river. The idea is that, in order to successfully navigate, we have to balance between when we do the work and when the river does the work. And that\u2019s easily applied to productivity culture: We\u2019re so accustomed to hustling, we don\u2019t remember how to float.\nCreativity helps solve big problems, which makes it a fundamental leadership capability we all need. Mustafa, when we consider team resilience, creativity is such a key part of navigating challenges and uncertainty. You study high-performance teams. What specifically have you noticed about managers and other leaders?\nMustafa Sarkar: Team learning is vital to resilience; teams that are on the same wavelength are better able to respond as a collective to difficult situations. Teams need time and space to perform in this way, and leaders are critical to shaping an environment and intentionally creating time and space for creativity. Effective leaders also have influence over the ideas that are generated.\nPrioritizing time and space for creativity is so important. But there\u2019s a misconception that prioritizing creativity comes at the expense of productivity. How do we overcome that to embrace the idea that focused work and detachment give teams a competitive advantage?\nHarfoush: Since we define productivity as continuous visual output, we tend to obsess over visible work performance. For most of us, the visible work \u2014 the presentation to the client, the final research report \u2014 is just a fraction of our process, maybe 25%. The remaining 75% is unseen, and so we think it\u2019s invisible to performance. And, from a resiliency perspective, we are accustomed to optimizing and getting drained as if it\u2019s an end state to be celebrated, rather than treating our creative energy as a sustainable resource to be renewed and replenished strategically.\nSarkar: There\u2019s an analogy about a cellphone battery: As humans, we often wait until we are at 5% energy to recharge, but we would never wait until our phone is at 5% battery power to charge it. We\u2019d probably start charging it at 30%. Why do we do it with our phones but not ourselves?\nWe know our best ideas and our best performance moments come after the rest, and we see that proven by professional athletes all the time. Why is it so hard to slow down?\nHarfoush: There\u2019s a myth that says your success is solely dependent on your ability to work hard. And that anytime you\u2019re not actively demonstrating that you\u2019re working hard, you are signaling that you\u2019re not deserving of your own success. In reality, we know that hard work can move the needle, yes, but there are so many other factors.\nSarkar: An important thing to consider when we talk about work devotion is identity and what fills your life outside of work. If you have multiple identities \u2014 if you\u2019re a father, a mother, a footballer, an exerciser, a cook, whatever it may be \u2014 you\u2019ll consider those aspects of your life very important. But if your identity is solely tied to work, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll see yourself and your success.\nOften there is a badge of honor around how hard we all work, especially among high performers. How can companies go about shifting that belief system?\nSarkar: Resilience is cultivated by design, not by default. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically, and that\u2019s why focusing on the work environment is so important. As a leader or manager, you must focus on proactively creating an environment where it is safe for people to speak up when they see things that aren\u2019t healthy, and creating opportunities where you can hold up your hand and acknowledge your own mistakes.\nHarfoush: To build on that, it\u2019s important to consider questions that contribute to environment: What does success look like here? What behaviors do we hold up as aspirational? How do we measure performance? How do we define performance?\nI also encourage clients to start with small experiments. Make hypotheses about what you think you can prove through experimentation. Maybe you\u2019ll see better strategic thinking and fewer mistakes when people aren\u2019t sleep deprived and overstressed. Get the data and build on what you learn.\nOne of the top questions we get from people managers at Google has been: What can I do now to increase my team\u2019s resilience and productivity down the road? What\u2019s your advice?\nSarkar: Resilience boils down to cultivating relationships, particularly because of remote and hybrid work. There\u2019s a saying that \u201cstrangers can\u2019t team,\u201d and many of us are in a situation now where we don\u2019t know our teammates. Working to cultivate relationships and shared values is more critical than ever.\nHarfoush: Productivity is a reflection of a system, and it can be anything that you want. So if you want to increase your team\u2019s productivity, then it\u2019s critical to specify what that means. Is it increased time for deep work? More periods of intense collaboration? Eliminating distractions through prioritization?\nAnother thing for managers to think about is anti-fragility \u2014 not just helping your team be productive and resilient through disruption, but using the disruption to grow and be better. As strategic thinkers, we have to be adaptive and responsive, and challenge assumptions and evolve. All of those things require a different relationship to change. So as leaders, we must really get to know ourselves, our creativity, our energy, and what drains and replenishes us.\nDownload and listen to the full conversation on Google Podcasts or wherever you find your favorite shows."

        "output": "To connect immediately with audiences on Google\u2019s feeds, it\u2019s important to create high-quality visual experiences that delight the eye while offering authentic, meaningful messages. Use these three tips to help you drive more sales with up to 3 billion people as they scroll through content on YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.\nYour images will be the first thing people notice when they come across your Discovery ads, so be sure to use the highest possible image resolution. Also, highlight your product or service to help people instantly understand what you\u2019re showcasing.\nTo more accurately illustrate how your products or services work, upload the highest resolution images possible (1200x628, 960x1200, and 1200x1200 pixels) and consider using images that show people using your products. Based on an internal analysis with Creative Works (formerly Unskippable Labs), images with a person drive 4% more clicks compared to images without a person.1\nUse overlay text sparingly. It can have a varied appearance on different devices and create a less compelling experience for people scrolling through their feeds. Our internal analysis with Creative Works shows that, on average, images without overlay text drive 9% more clicks.2\nAudiences, messaging, and creative assets that have performed well for your other media campaigns, such as video or social, can help you unlock performance with highly engaged audiences on Discovery ads. Be sure to include at least 10 converting Search campaign keywords in each of your custom intent audiences, and make the most of Google\u2019s automated audience features: Advertisers who use audience expansion with Discovery ads see 52% more conversions at a comparable cost per acquisition to their originally selected audience.3\nIn summer 2020, U.K. fashion brand Ted Baker used its social ads creative assets to build Discovery campaigns, connecting with previous website visitors and shoppers interested in clothing. As a result, Ted Baker saw a revenue lift of 70% and a 62% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) in under one year.\nAutomated campaign types need the right budget, a variety of great assets, and enough time to analyze the performance of your ads to determine which settings for your creative assets and bids work the best across your audiences. Your campaign optimizes your settings for peak performance over time.\nIf you\u2019re running Discovery ads for the first time, give your campaign time and space to learn what works by choosing an average daily budget at least 10 times the value of your target cost-per-action bid. Then wait for at least 40 conversions before making any changes. Whenever you change your assets, audiences, or bids, your campaign will need two to three weeks to adjust and optimize for the best results.\nFor more detailed examples and tips for how to set up Discovery ads, check out our full best practices guide."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in the entertainment industry. Here, actor, author, and advocate Selma Blair explains why it\u2019s time for media to shift toward a world where everyone sees themselves represented and how to build belonging into media. A version of this article first appeared in Variety on July 19, 2022.\nStorytelling is powerful. Stories can ultimately shape your identity and how the world sees you.\nThroughout my life, my story has been told by other people: Manic depressive. Drunk. Mean.\nIn my memoir, \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I wrote about never feeling a sense of belonging. Throughout my life, I often felt disconnected from my body, out of control, as if I didn\u2019t belong in my own skin. I learned not to show or talk about pain because I didn\u2019t want it to define me, nor did I understand what my pain meant.\nIn 2018, I was finally able to tell other people how I identified myself: disabled. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and learned it had been attacking my central nervous system for years. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have anyone in the entertainment industry to look up to who had a disability or was open about their diagnosis, and I didn\u2019t see my experiences reflected in the stories being told on screen. Even though it was difficult learning I had MS, at least it had a name now. After being confused about who I was for so long, I finally understood myself \u2014 and I belonged to a community. In a way, it was also freeing.\nI started thinking more about the power of storytelling and why representation in media matters. If I had seen and heard from people who were like me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone. Perhaps if I\u2019d had more diverse representation to look up to, I would have learned about my own diagnosis earlier on (I was shocked when I learned one of my idols, Joan Didion, also had MS).\nNow I truly feel comfortable embracing all parts of my identity \u2014 including my disability \u2014 and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time we shift the story about how disabled people are represented. It\u2019s one of the reasons I started looking at the work Google has been doing to build inclusive practices into its marketing. United by shared values and a vision that authentically represents disabled people\u2019s stories, I want to help the rest of the creative industry use Google\u2019s learnings to build a world where everyone belongs.\nSince my diagnosis, I\u2019ve become close friends with Andra\u00e9a LaVant, a leading voice in the disability community and founder of LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and communications firm. I\u2019ve learned so much from her and her team and the work they\u2019ve been doing with brands, including how they\u2019ve supported Google to bring disability into its advertising and internal programs. All In, Google\u2019s inclusive marketing toolkit, draws on years of internal insights and collaborations to build intentionality into every step of its advertising process.\nIn partnership with LaVant Consulting and many other leading organizations, Google launched an accessible marketing playbook on All In as a practical guide for every marketing effort. This is such a powerful resource for so many reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s informed by the lived experiences of people with disabilities.\nThis approach deeply reflects a core principle in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. Who better to build a strong sense of belonging for disabled people than we who belong to the community?\nWhile I want to use my voice to support the disability community, I also strongly believe that I can\u2019t be the only spokesperson for everyone with a disability. Our experience is ours alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pull in as many people and experts from the community as possible.\nIn addition to LaVant Consulting, Google has worked with Disability:IN, GLAAD, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Ad Council, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (The 4A\u2019s), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, Cannes Lions, and many other expert organizations across the world to create All In and contribute to Google\u2019s continued inclusivity practice.\nThis level of collaboration creates space for the more than 1 billion disabled people around the world. It also acknowledges that each person has a unique background and set of circumstances. My disability is just one identity, and my experience is just that \u2014 one person\u2019s experience. Disability will touch everyone at some point in their life, whether permanent, temporary, visible, invisible, or age related. Partnering with diverse experts and perspectives also emphasizes the opportunity to consider people\u2019s whole identities, including gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education.\nThis matters beyond advertising, All In\u2019s original focus. There is a movement happening, and the entertainment industry needs to be a part of this cultural shift. Everyone benefits from accessibility, because it opens up work to a wider, more diverse audience.\nI\u2019ve already learned a lot through the accessible marketing playbook on All In; it would have been a helpful resource while I was writing \u201cMean Baby.\u201d For example, throughout my memoir I described people as \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair.\u201d The playbook suggests that a more inclusive description would be \u201cwheelchair user\u201d or \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d This is a great example of something that may seem small, yet is so impactful.\nAll In also taught me that disability inclusion is a mindset, not a box to check. It requires a sustained commitment, a constantly evolving work process, and ongoing learning for each and every one of us. This is important for us to remember if we\u2019re to make meaningful change.\nIn \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I write that the thing about limitations is that they aren\u2019t really about you at all. They\u2019re often constructed by others, and when they\u2019re removed, you realize that all this time you\u2019ve been capable of soaring.\nThe entertainment industry has the ability to do so much to help tear down these limitations. Committing to accessibility breaks down barriers, enabling creatives to be better in their work. It\u2019s time for the wider creative media industry to commit to inclusion and elevate the significance of this growing cultural shift. Everyone deserves to have their story represented authentically and feel a sense of belonging.\nWhether you\u2019re a producer, creator, marketer, or actor, All In is for you. These are steps anybody can take today. Commit to helping change the creative industry to be more inclusive by learning how on Google.com/All-In."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Data analytics should be top of mind for every advertiser, but building a successful and effective analytics team can be challenging. Here, Google marketing and analytics leaders break down key principles businesses can use to realize the potential of a tech-savvy analytics team.\nDigital transformation \u2014 the process of using digital technologies to modernize business performance, agility, and sustainability \u2014 is widely seen by marketing leaders as the key to future-proofing organizations. To get the most out of digital innovations, companies must be able to pinpoint where to focus their efforts and to understand what strategies are working best. That\u2019s why a strong data analytics team that can communicate real-time data insights to the C-suite is crucial to driving meaningful digital transformation.\nCompanies that build a successful analytics team are more likely to see revenue, profit, and market share gains.1 Yet, according to the Digital Maturity Benchmark, only 9% of businesses use insights and technology effectively to create better consumer experiences. Why?\nThrough Google\u2019s own experience building world-leading analytics teams and our work with hundreds of other companies, we\u2019ve identified three core principles that can help businesses overcome challenges and build successful analytics strategies and teams.\nWhen it comes to investing in your organization\u2019s analytics, prioritize people over tools. Investing in people leads to a flexible analytics capability, which can adapt to a changing business environment without locking the organization into an unwieldy system of software and tools.\nWhile many Fortune 500 companies have made great investments in analytics tools, most still struggle to make meaningful data-driven business decisions. That\u2019s largely because this investment strategy makes the mistake of thinking that tools, rather than people, are the solution to building better analytics. The tools themselves can only go so far without the right people behind them.\nThese misplaced efforts led us to develop a 10/90 rule for web analytics success: Invest 10% of the analytics budget in tools and the remaining 90% in people. For example, if you\u2019re paying a web analytics vendor $25,000 for an annual contract, you should be prepared to invest a further $225,000 in people to get meaningful value from that data.\nTo be sure, software systems and vendor professional services are important components of a successful analytics team. But it\u2019s the analysts, not the tools, who transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the 10/90 rule, CxOs can draw on the winning combination of computer processing power and human judgment to inform marketing activities and business decisions, and understand consumer behaviors.\nAnalytics teams thrive in dynamic environments that reward curiosity, encourage innovation, and set high expectations. Building and reinforcing this type of culture can help put organizations on a path to earning impactful returns from analytics investments.\nAn active analytics culture thrives when CxOs reward curiosity over perfection. Encourage analysts to challenge convention and ask questions as a method to improve quality and reduce risks. This thinking goes hand in hand with a test-and-learn mentality, where pushing boundaries through proactive experimentation helps identify what works, and optimize accordingly.\nIt\u2019s also important to create a culture where failure and success are celebrated equally. Giving airtime to what went wrong allows the team to more effectively learn from their mistakes and see that perfection is an unhealthy pipe dream. This encourages an environment that holds analysts accountable for delivering quality processes and results, further helping to mitigate risk and improve marketing programs.\nHigh-performing analytics capabilities cannot and will not happen without the full commitment of an organization\u2019s senior leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that leaders collaborate with analysts to understand the data behind decision-making.\nC-level leaders can create an analytics-friendly environment by knowing when to collect data, presenting business challenges to analyst teams, and consistently seeking to quantify goals and objectives. Leading by example, data-savvy CxOs can show leaders that it\u2019s better to go to analyst teams with problems to solve rather than requests for specific deliverables, championing these non-analysts to be experts in their distinct businesses \u2014 rather than analytics.\nMaintaining a winning analytics capability requires endorsement up and down an organization. This sets the tone for a company that values understanding measurement solutions as well as the problem-solving expertise analysts can deliver across the organization.\nNow\u2019s the time for businesses to establish a data-centric culture that positions them to win with analytics today and in the future. Companies that do it are more effective and efficient, earn impactful insights from their data, and can attract and retain top-tier analytics talent.\nSo start laying the foundation for your company\u2019s in-house data analytics infrastructure immediately. Audit your organization\u2019s current analytics capabilities to identify gaps and opportunities in your marketing strategy. Then, identify what leadership you need to close gaps in capability and design by successfully implementing the principles we\u2019ve shared.\nBuild your organization\u2019s own high-performing analytics team, and join the future-ready businesses that are taking their marketing further."

        "output": "While some brands are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their messaging and marketing campaigns, an essential component of inclusivity may be missing: accessibility.\nIt's especially important to cater to people who are typically underserved in the digital world. For example, people who are blind or have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, are neurodivergent, or those who have motor conditions. These individuals often face barriers when an experience is not properly designed. Online journeys are often convoluted experiences for people, and brands need to ensure their apps and websites don\u2019t add further complications.\nBuilding accessible user experiences will soon become a regulatory requirement too. This year, European Union member states are adopting the European Accessibility Act into their laws. The expectation is that all products and online services will need to be accessible once the requirements come into force in 2025.\nSo where do you start on your accessibility journey? We\u2019ve spoken with four brands about how they think about and build for accessibility and disability inclusiveness. Here\u2019s what we learned.\nAdvertising is powerful because it connects with people through storytelling. But what if someone misses key elements of that story? This question led consumer goods manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G) to incorporate audio description, a voice-over describing what\u2019s happening, into their video ads.\n\u201cThe introduction of audio description stems from my personal experiences,\u201d explains Sam Latif, company accessibility leader at P&G, who is blind. \u201cI was in a meeting when an ad for Flash played, but all I could hear was the song \u2018Flash\u2019 by Queen. What I didn\u2019t realize was that a dog was singing that song, because, without audio description, I couldn\u2019t understand the humor of the ad.\u201d\nThe P&G team worked with The Royal National Institute of Blind People to learn how audio description is done and integrated it into its ads.\nP&G didn\u2019t stop there. In 2021, they launched the first audio-described Super Bowl ad. It also ran its first adaptive audio description trial in the U.K. This means applying audio description to TV ads that don\u2019t have enough natural gaps in the dialogue to provide a description. And, most recently, it added audio description to its YouTube channel.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have all the answers but are proud of the progress we have made,\u201d says Latif. \u201cExperiences like this have led to change, with audio description opening up our advertising to millions more people around the world.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway conducts research directly with people with disabilities, from customers who are blind or have low vision to those with nonvisible disabilities, such as dyslexia. Its goal: understand people\u2019s first-hand experiences when using the delivery app and build inclusive products.\n\u201cObserving people with access needs using our app has been a strong facilitator of change and awareness across the organization,\u201d says Naoil Sbai, a global research team lead at the company. \u201cIt helped us realize the impact that simple changes could make. And it made us rethink how people interact with our app.\u201d\nThis motivated the research team to identify optimization opportunities with the Android Accessibility Scanner. The automated tool flagged key recommendations, such as increasing the size of touch targets \u2014 the tappable space around a navigation button.\nOnce this issue was known, it took them just a day to make the touch targets bigger. Something seemingly small \u2014 and a quick fix \u2014 can make a world of difference to customers, especially those with limited dexterity. And, as a bonus, this makes it easier for anyone to order their food quickly while on-the-go.\nL'Or\u00e9al had accessibility front of mind when building its new website. \u201cThe first step toward accessibility is to understand the different types of disabilities and how they affect millions of people,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Cunche, the beauty company\u2019s digital project director.\nWhen it learned how customers with low vision and cognitive conditions use the website, it set out to raise awareness within the company. It adopted the industry-standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to improve the website experience. And it partnered with an agency that specializes in this topic to help implement the guidelines across the business.\nWith the basic foundations in place, the product team took it one step further by layering on additional features. For example, they now offer accessibility controls in the website navigation menu, so people can select settings based on their needs.\nThe first feature is high-contrast mode. This removes background images and allows people to view the site in a strong white-on-black contrast, making it easier to read and focus on the content.\nThe team also added an option to deactivate animations to reveal a static header image on the page instead. This can help people with vestibular disorders, for whom motion can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea.\n\u201cAfter several tests and user surveys, all results are very positive and encourage us to go further,\u201d continues Cunche. \u201cWith knowledge comes responsibility, and only then can we create a better digital experience \u2014 for everyone.\u201d\nBooking.com is a large and complex organization, with many teams working on different elements of the digital travel company\u2019s app. As different people, code, and designs feed into the app, some features don\u2019t always behave as they should.\nFor example, during testing, the accessibility team found that some navigational tabs were not working correctly with screen readers \u2014 software that reads visual information from the screen out loud. In some instances, the screen reader would read out the wrong tab. Someone wanting to navigate to the \u201cCar Rentals\u201d section could be accidentally directed to the \u201cTaxis\u201d page.\nThe accessibility team partnered with the design systems team to update the components \u2014 the building blocks within an app \u2014 so that accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, were built in from the start.\n\u201cIf we use components that are accessible by default, we can innovate and be agile, without having to focus on getting it right all the time, every time,\u201d explains Booking.com Engineering Manager and Accessibility Lead Parham Doustdar. Doustdar has been blind since birth and is an expert at navigating websites and apps with screen readers, so this accessibility issue was very familiar to him.\nHowever, this work didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, because some legacy components did not reflect the changes. The team partnered with another group in their organization to update the technology so the accessibility changes could be adopted throughout the entire app. Now, as pages are built and updated, everyone working on the app automatically uses components that have accessibility built in.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter how accessible your components are if no one is using them,\u201d continues Doustdar. \u201cYou have to harness existing initiatives, where possible, and partner with other teams to increase adoption.\u201d\nHere are some final tips to help you improve accessibility.\nAnd, above all, know that people\u2019s varied needs continue to change, so you\u2019re never finished creating more accessible user experiences. The most important thing is to start."

        "output": "Ben Jones is the global director of Google's Creative Works, a newly formed team with the mission of helping brands drive better business results with more effective creative.\nNo matter what tools or technology you have at your disposal, good creative is the last unfair advantage of ads that work. It\u2019s only natural that marketing and creative teams develop their own \u201crules\u201d about what makes for effective creative on YouTube ads. We often find that those rules could benefit from a reframe. The truth is, successful brands on YouTube use creative strategies and mindsets that bust assumptions. Here are a few misperceptions we've encountered and some suggestions for how you might reframe them into best practices for YouTube ad creative.\nYou should absolutely take risks on YouTube. But that doesn\u2019t mean shooting in the dark to find what works. There are some basic principles to making effective YouTube ads, and these principles can inform which risks are worth taking. The ABCDs of effective creative on YouTube are based on years of research on tens of thousands of ads from all over the world to uncover which specific creative elements contribute to the biggest impact on YouTube.\nAds that follow the ABCDs as a guide have been shown to yield 30% lift in short-term sales likelihood and 17% lift in long-term brand contribution.1 There\u2019s still plenty of room to build creatively on those foundations, but keeping them in mind will better equip you to take those risks and make more effective creative choices.\nWhile there are certainly creative principles you can start with, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to execution. Looking at the wide spectrum of effective YouTube ads across marketing objectives around the world, we\u2019ve found that focusing on what your ad says and how it makes people feel is more important than the way your ad looks.\nEffective YouTube ads can be many things, like an episodic docu-series, an undercover investigation, a user-narrated product review, or an interview with the CEO. It can be a music video partnership with a YouTube creator that becomes the No. 1 most-watched video in the world in its first 24 hours, leading to a 100% increase in year-over-year sales. It can even be an anime series starring the product as the hero, which sells out immediately, beats the team\u2019s KPIs, and boosts year-over-year product sales by more than 100%.\nYouTube is a breeding ground for creativity, and advertisers have as much of an opportunity to participate in that as anyone else on the platform. Effective ads give viewers a taste of your brand, product, or service \u2014 and that leaves a lot of room for creativity.\nSometimes ads that are meant to drive action get a bad rap. There\u2019s concern that lower-funnel ads cheapen the story or sell the brand short. But we\u2019ve seen brands get really creative with calls to action. It just requires thinking about the ad as the start of the viewer\u2019s next action, allowing the work to extend beyond that one impression. This is especially important on YouTube where 63% of viewers in the markets we\u2019ve studied say they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on the platform.2\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, AR, AU, BR, CA, CL, CO, FR, IT IN, JP, MX, PE, KR, ES, U.K., U.S., Why Video study, n=32075, A18-64 gen pop video users, March 2020\u2013Aug. 2020.\nA creative way to customize lower-funnel ads is to align with the viewer\u2019s passion points and make a more directed offer. Or you could employ a bit of reverse psychology like McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia did, when the team told viewers not to search for a product, knowing that would spark curiosity and encourage them to do just that.\nGucci U.K. got creative with ad sequencing to hone in on viewers most interested in its products as part of its holiday season campaign. Partnering with filmmaker Harmony Korine, the team produced a colorful, nostalgia-tinged video ad. With ad sequencing, they first raised awareness by featuring a campaign teaser video that led to the full director's cut on YouTube. Then, to increase consideration, Gucci showed a 6-second bumper ad series to viewers who showed interest in the teaser. Finally, the brand served product-focused ads to those viewers using TrueView for action and TrueView for shopping ads that connected them directly with the link to purchase. The campaign itself was viewed 5.4 million times globally with a 58% view completion rate, and it drove 44.5K clicks to Gucci\u2019s website.\nThere\u2019s a difference between having an experimental approach to creating video ads and conducting a one-off test. The former is a mindset that reaps deep learnings and keeps you from relying on long-held assumptions. The latter is a thing you do every once in a while, and works best for campaign-specific learnings.\nAn experimental mindset doesn\u2019t have to slow you down or cost you more, and it will pay off in the long term. Think of every campaign your brand puts out there as an experiment. See what you learn, which new questions emerge, and what needs to be optimized. Advertisers who successfully used Video Experiments saw 60% higher ad recall from the better performing creative.3\nSource: Google Data, Global, Successful Video Experiments were those with a significant difference in Brand Lift between experiment arms, 2019\u20132020.\nStart by changing one variable (big or small), like simple edits to the pace, the framing of your opening shot, or a variety of copy tweaks. Even the smallest changes can make a big impact. The more you experiment, the more you will understand not only what levers to pull creatively for your brand, but deeper insights about your audience.\nAspiration, a digital banking alternative focused on social good, has taken an experimental mindset when it comes to video creative. The team consistently tests through the entire production process. They run ads with variants of headlines, calls to action, and even landing pages to fully optimize their creative for success. By running different versions and looking at Brand Lift and Search lift results, they\u2019re able to determine the more effective creative to put their weight behind. Thanks to these optimizations and experiments, Aspiration was able to drive a 25% lift in relative brand awareness, over 16,000 email leads, and more than 3,400 new users.\nCreating assets tailored for each platform usually requires more lift than most brands and creative teams can spare. What we\u2019ve found is that when you start with a digital audience in mind, by grabbing attention immediately; building for mobile with tighter framing, large-type text, and color contrast for visibility on smaller screens; and with sound on, your ads will perform better everywhere, including on TV.\nThen for YouTube in particular, layer on some of its specific capabilities like personalizing your video ads at scale, like the Greek pizza chain Pizza Fan, or transforming a TV spot into a multipart video ad using ad sequencing, like LinkedIn U.K.\nIn its first ever brand-led campaign, LinkedIn U.K. had a beautiful 60-second TV spot. The team devised a test. They would run the TV spot on YouTube to see how it performed, and they would also run tailored-for-YouTube assets: four separate short-form videos that featured a large on-screen logo, with sound on, and sequenced together to serve to viewers over time. Hands down, the YouTube-tailored assets performed better. \u201cWe saw increased consideration by 20%, ad recall up 178%, and a campaign that was 2.3X more cost efficient in driving brand lift,\u201d said Katriona O\u2019Leary, the brand\u2019s group manager for paid media.\nGreat brands around the world are constantly pushing to rethink long-held assumptions about what works on YouTube. Follow the foundational principles of effective creative, think creatively, build for digital, and take advantage of the capabilities YouTube offers \u2014 all with an experimental mindset \u2014 and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making effective video ad creative.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio. Create with Google curates the creative insight, inspiration, and tools you need to make effective creative work \u2014 all in one place."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dorothea Wiesmann Rothuizen and Wojtek Skut are engineers at Google, where they work on continually improving AI and large language models. They are a part of the team implementing new capabilities into Google Ads features, such as broad match.\nThere\u2019s been a wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, largely due to immense improvements in the underlying technology. Large language models (LLMs), for example, now enable a deeper understanding of language, which has led to conversations with AI that are much more natural and intuitive.\nThis same technology has supercharged broad match, a Google Ads setting that helps brands reach more people with their ads and reduces manual keyword work.\nWhile broad match has existed since the dawn of Google Ads, its early version wasn\u2019t perfect and began losing momentum about 15 years ago. Back then, it could have matched a search query, such as \u201ctreating a pet at home,\u201d to an irrelevant keyword, like \u201ctreats for pets.\u201d At the same time, \u201ctreating a pet at home\u201d would not have matched to the related \u201cwithout a vet,\u201d since the two phrases don\u2019t contain any of the same words. But, thanks to new advances in AI and continuous updates, broad match has evolved and can now better interpret nuance and context.\nIn fact, today\u2019s broad match understands people\u2019s search queries on a deeper level and can identify keyword search intent. This makes it one of the most effective solutions for search advertising.\nBelieve it or not, when broad match first launched, Google\u2019s engineering team would manually write out the synonyms for a keyword and cast a really wide net. For example, an ad keyword including \u201ccheap\u201d could match with searches for \u201cinexpensive\u201d and \u201cshoestring.\u201d While \u201cshoestring\u201d can be a different way of saying \u201cbudget,\u201d a user could alternatively use this word to search for shoelaces.\nThanks to new AI capabilities, LLMs can now better understand a user\u2019s search intent. We train them with billions of pieces of text so they can learn all the different variations and meanings of a word or phrase, and what sequences make sense. Once that fundamental foundation is in place, we will assign the AI a specific task, like matching ads to search queries.\nWhile the language technology can understand the potential demand that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s most effective when combined with Smart Bidding. This automated bidding strategy factors in a wide range of signals and surrounding data points in a privacy-safe way \u2014 such as search history, interests, and past purchases \u2014 to build a predictive model that helps advertisers identify the audiences most likely to convert.\nHere are three of the most significant improvements we\u2019ve made to broad match.\nIn the early days of broad match, the technology would connect the dots between keywords in a search query and an ad, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the order of the words in the query into account.\nFor instance, someone looking for a flight from London to Paris could have been shown an ad for a flight from Paris to London. To prevent this from happening, Google\u2019s search specialists would\u2019ve recommended a different keyword strategy to those advertisers. But today, broad match knows that going from A to B isn\u2019t the same as going from B to A. This improvement has also been applied to other areas where a search query only works one way.\nHere\u2019s an example. A user might be looking for a place to \u201cexchange euros to pounds\u201d or searching for a \u201cusb to usbc cable,\u201d and seeing an ad in which these words are in reverse order would not be relevant to them. Fortunately, the latest version of broad match now understands their search intent.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve often been asked: \u201cWhat happens when two ads for the same advertiser match to the same search query?\u201d Previously, broad match would have looked at an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank to help determine which ad to show, but which may not always have been the best choice.\nTo improve relevance \u2014 for advertisers and users \u2014 today\u2019s broad match considers supporting information, such as other keywords in the ad group and even the ad\u2019s landing page. And, thanks to the increased capabilities of the LLM that powers broad match, it better understands the meaning of a search query and its variations to improve relevance there too.\nMultilingual search is a third area that has seen a lot of development. Broad match now recognizes that some people might switch between languages when looking for something online, and it uses that information to serve the right ads.\nThe expat community is a common use case. For example, Turkish people living in the Netherlands or British people residing in Spain may be searching in their first language but looking for local-language results for the country they live in.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that running your campaign in one language means that you\u2019ll get traffic for other languages, since campaign success still relies on language settings and localized creative. But, in countries where many people are bilingual, it\u2019s helpful to know that broad match can match relevant, local traffic to an ad, even when the search is made in another language.\nBroad match may not be quite as old as \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d but it\u2019s been around for a long time. And, just like in the iconic 1985 movie, it shows us that sometimes looking at something from the past helps you understand its value in the present.\nThat said, while AI-powered language upgrades have made broad match far more effective for search advertising, it will continue to need a smart marketer in the driver\u2019s seat. Savvy marketers will check performance, select the right bidding strategy, and monitor new queries identified by broad match to bring in new customers. After all, you might discover new insights about your audience throughout the campaign.\nAI learns from you, and you learn from AI. Broad match\u2019s success depends on the team that uses it, just like the time-traveling car from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d needed the input and creativity from its creator, Doc Brown, to drive into the past \u2014 and the future.Tune into the Google Marketing Platform Partner Podcast episode \u201cTalking AI: How a deeper language understanding is transforming broad match\u201d to hear more about the ways large language models are supercharging broad match.

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s business environment, planning ahead simply isn\u2019t enough. Marketers need to balance early planning with an ability to pivot. Especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty when budgets are under pressure, marketing and finance teams must work together even more closely to effectively deploy resources and maximize ROI.\nAn ingrained benefit of digital marketing has always been the ability to quickly change media plans and constantly optimize. More than ever, marketers have to lean into an agile mindset to shift budgets to the biggest opportunities. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy task.\nIn my past CMO roles at Calvin Klein Inc. and L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, I remember how often industry media buying platforms were distinctly siloed by channel: search, online video, display, social, and more. These silos carried over to our budget and organizational structures, creating friction and inefficiency whenever we tried to optimize performance across many marketing channels.\nBut as technology and solutions like AI and machine learning have rapidly improved, so have opportunities to show up for customers in more connected and consistent ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a multiplying force for businesses. You can more precisely scale your marketing presence across channels, stay on top of consumer needs and trends, and achieve new levels of agility within your marketing.\nThese opportunities are empowering marketers to rethink their old approaches to multichannel digital campaigns to improve ROI. To better understand this shift, Google partnered with Kantar to survey over 2,400 global marketers and explore the importance of agility in planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels. From this study, we\u2019ve identified three core areas that require a careful balancing act to unlock greater agility and developed guiding principles for success.\nWhile initial budget planning is considered fundamental, marketers should also leave room for flexibility. In our study, marketers are considered behaviorally budget agile if they adjust budgets across digital channels on a weekly or more frequent basis. Based on this metric, nearly a quarter of the marketers surveyed are considered budget agile.1\nBudget agile does not, however, mean unprepared. Thirty-one percent of budget-agile marketers engage in formal marketing planning to align on strategy and digital-media budget allocations every month versus 18% of non-agile marketers.2\nBeing budget agile can also lead to better business outcomes. Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 And 48% of budget-agile marketers state that their marketing performance exceeded internal expectations and marketing KPIs, compared to 33% of marketers who are not budget agile.4\nThis finding did surprise us: Many of the marketers surveyed considered themselves more budget agile than they actually are based on their budgeting behaviors. On average, 60% of marketers who say they are \u201cextremely agile\u201d only make budget adjustments across digital channels monthly or less frequently.5\nWhile this gap between perception and actual behavior happens at all levels of an organization, C-level executives are 2X more likely than individual contributors to perceive their business as extremely budget agile.6\nThe disconnect between perceived and actual budget agility reveals that there\u2019s room for improvement across organizations. For me personally, empowering my teams to work with greater agility means I need to step back and allow them to make faster decisions. But this isn\u2019t the case for many businesses. Indeed, the budget approval process is quite lengthy for 54% of non-agile marketers, where changes to digital budgets of 20% or more take a month or longer for approval.7 And even agile marketers must deal with time-consuming approvals. For 59% of budget-agile marketers, changes to digital budget of 20% or more take a week or longer for approval.8\nMarketers also face heavy oversight and scrutiny over budget changes and reallocations. Fifty-two percent of marketers say that executive or C-level individuals have a heavy influence on budget adjustments after the initial planning period.9\nFortunately, our research shows that companies don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes to become more budget agile. Even brands and agencies that invest in dedicated channel expertise and specialist teams can still achieve quick wins to drive better collaboration and results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to break down organizational silos. Fifty-eight percent of marketers have created more cross-channel team touchpoints, such as meetings, training, and information sharing to improve collaboration.10 And, compared to their non-agile peers, budget-agile marketers are twice as likely to call their marketing across channels \u201cvery tightly integrated.\u201d11\nThey\u2019re also leaning into their agency partnerships to stay on the cutting edge. Agencies can help encourage an agile mindset when it comes to budgeting and breaking down organizational silos.\nForty-two percent of budget-agile marketers say their agency partners greatly influence adjustments they make after initial budget planning, compared to only 31% of non-agile marketers.12\nNext, more teams are setting shared goals that allow them to take a results-first rather than a channel-first approach. This starts with implementing consistent measurement and success metrics that help marketers align on a common language, even when they work on different channels. In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed have instituted shared metrics and KPIs across channels to improve collaboration.13\nMarketers are also relying on Google AI to maximize budget agility across channels in real time. Budget-agile marketers are 29% more likely than non-agile marketers to use cross-channel automation.14\nOne example of this is demonstrated by the global streaming service Discovery+, which adopted Performance Max to improve how the brand optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. Regina Sommese, group vice president of paid media and global subscriber acquisitions at Discovery+, says, \u201cBeing budget fluid has always been critical for us, but the process has historically been manual. Performance Max allowed us to move away from managing siloed campaigns to one holistic optimization approach.\u201d\nAs global brands like Discovery+ have found, driving reliable results and creating a culture of experimentation don\u2019t have to be at odds. In fast-changing environments, marketers who can strike the right balance between investing in proven strategies and funding experiments that unlock new opportunities will deliver long-term growth. In fact, 31% of budget-agile marketers say it\u2019s \u201cvery easy\u201d to get additional budget to start new tests that weren\u2019t included in the initial media budget, compared to just 9% of non-agile marketers.15\nIn times of uncertainty, it can also be a natural instinct to become more conservative and pull back on marketing budgets. Only 17% of budget-agile marketers and 6% of non-agile marketers have channels with uncapped or unlimited budgets that make it easy to increase budgets for new opportunities.16\nInside Google\u2019s own marketing team, we\u2019re taking the exact opposite approach. We\u2019ve partnered with our finance teams to prove the incremental value of marketing by aligning marketing goals with real business outcomes, like profitability and customer lifetime value. We also reforecast our global budgets regularly to ensure that we can request more funds if we have room to scale successful tests against finance-approved ROI thresholds. This gives us greater freedom to avoid artificial \u201ccaps\u201d on digital media budgets that can limit our ability to improve results.\nAgile marketers help their teams move faster, pivot to take advantage of new performance opportunities, and ultimately drive more business growth. By finding the right balance across budget agility, cross-channel team collaboration, and experimentation, marketers can invest their resources more effectively to maximize ROI."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in advertising. Here, KR Liu, Google\u2019s head of brand accessibility, shares her personal story and why accessible marketing is critical for every brand.\nI am female, queer, and disabled. For much of my life, these parts of my identity were rarely, if ever, authentically represented in media and advertising. This made me feel different, unvalued, and alone. As a result, I spent more than a decade hiding who I was in my personal life and at work.\nThen, a few years ago, I began to recognize that each part of my identity was essential and that no one part could exist without the other. It was the first time I felt as though people cared about all of me, rather than only my disability. That feeling was transformative.\nSadly, many others can relate to my experience of not feeling fully seen and represented in society, or in brand advertising. Great ads should reflect everyone, including the 1 billion people worldwide who identify as disabled and control 8 trillion dollars in spending. They should also acknowledge intersectionality, because like me, every disabled person has many dimensions to their identity that make them, them.\nSource: The World Bank, Global, April 2022.\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a day job that focuses on improving the accessibility of Google\u2019s marketing for our billions of users. While accessibility has always been core to our company\u2019s mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 being truly accessible is a journey, and we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to improve, and we are hoping to help other brands improve too.\nA year ago, we shared Google.com/All-In, an inclusive marketing toolkit for brands and agencies. Today, I\u2019m excited to share that All In now includes an all-new playbook on accessible marketing, which we developed in partnership with LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN, and has been endorsed by the American Association of Ad Agencies, Ad Council, Cannes Lions, and many other leading organizations.\nThe playbook has meaningfully guided our marketing this past year, and is the result of yearslong research and collaboration across many accessibility topics \u2014 from web experience to authentic depictions of people with disabilities. We\u2019re sharing it publicly with the hope it will improve the representation of disabled people in the media and help create work that is fully accessible. And, here, I\u2019m sharing three core principles from the playbook, with hope that it will inspire you to visit All In to learn more.\nDisabled people are their own experts, which is why it\u2019s so important to bring in their voices from the start. Often this involves dedicating the resources required to do accessible marketing right, such as training and support for internal teams.\nFor many companies, this may also involve leaning on a specialized third party for guidance. At Google, we sought out partnerships with several experts in disability inclusion, including LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN. Partnerships like these allow you show allyship and engage directly with the disabled community, which helps to expand the ideas that fuel your work.\nFor marketing to feel truly inclusive and accessible, brands must think about people with disabilities holistically, and consider the full spectrum of markers that comprise identity. Beyond disability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education level are just a few of the additional ways that people may identify themselves.\nFailing to recognize and reflect intersectionality in your messages runs the risk of reducing disabled people\u2019s multidimensional identities into oversimplified stories that can perpetuate stereotypes, rather than uplifting them. An excellent rule of thumb is to always opt for nuanced narratives, preferably ones that come directly from the people who are part of the narrative.\nOne example of this is our campaign, \u201cA CODA Story,\u201d which shares the multigenerational personal experience of Tony Lee, an Asian American Googler and a child of deaf adults (CODA). The film portrays Lee and his family as they bridge gaps in distance and communication during the pandemic by using Google\u2019s assistive technologies.\nBest practices for disability inclusion and accessibility marketing change over time as technology evolves and culture shifts. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey that depends heavily on the needs of people with disabilities. Like other forms of inclusion, accessibility should be a constant commitment that\u2019s embedded into every aspect of your brand campaigns \u2014 from conception to execution, and beyond.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on accessible marketing, but we recognize that there\u2019s plenty of work ahead. Achieving our accessibility goals is a continual process, and we are perpetually learning from it.\nOne thing we\u2019ve proved over and over again is that accessibility and disability inclusive marketing are good for all people, and the benefits don\u2019t stop there. When everyone can fully access and engage with your products, content, and experiences, it\u2019s good for business. Brands that prioritize this concept as a human and business imperative will find that it opens up their work to a more diverse audience. Committing to accessibility in marketing breaks down barriers and enables brands to be better in their work, which is better for all users.\nTogether, we can drive a cultural shift that represents and celebrates people with disabilities as their whole selves. A world where everyone can see themselves is one where everyone has what they need to thrive."

        "output": "No\u00ebl Paasch, creative director at Google\u2019s Creative Works, leads brand and agency partnerships to determine best practices in advertising on YouTube. Here, she shares results from over two years of research to better understand the effectiveness of food, beverage, and restaurant video ads.\nShould your opening shot feature a satisfied customer enjoying your product mid-bite? Should it set the scene, steadily leading up to the product reveal?\nWhen it comes to creative decisions for video ads, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish pure aesthetics from what drives results. Without hard data, it\u2019s impossible to understand the psychology behind viewers\u2019 responses.\nOur ABCDs for creative effectiveness are data-informed, tested guidelines that can be applied universally to any video ad. In fact, Nielsen found that food, beverage, and restaurant ads that closely followed the ABCDs saw, on average, 31% higher sales lift.1 Supported by third-party research, our team recently conducted additional analyses to uncover more actionable creative insights around food ads. Here\u2019s what they found.\nThe experience of food is so much more than just its taste. A chocolate chip cookie is just as much its salty-sweet, fresh-from-the-oven smell, iconic craggy texture, and gooey chocolate melting on your fingers as it is its flavor. Our analysis shows that you can engage both sight and sound to make up for the lack of other sensory details.\nTake Magnum Ruby\u2019s ad, for example. When the protagonist takes a big bite of the chocolate-coated ice cream, the sound effect of the chocolate layer shattering evokes the experience of biting into a Magnum ice cream. Together, sight and sound are more compelling than either sense would be alone, summoning the memory of smell and taste.\nIt goes without saying that texture plays a big role in the characterization of any food. Would fresh pizza be as appealing without its gooey cheese or soft, bready crust?\nResearch shows that the majority of viewers watch ads on their mobile devices, so conveying the full visual through close-up shots of the product is extra important. Clear, crisp visuals help to communicate the product benefit quickly. This is generally good advice for any vertical on YouTube, but especially for food, beverage, and restaurant brands.\nC\u00f4te d'Or used this technique to great effect in their holiday ad. In each shot of the product, the chocolate takes up the full screen. The sheen of its smooth exterior and the grooves of the nut filling are so vivid, the viewer may as well have the product in front of them.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much one ad can show of the product itself. With limited time, shorter-form ads are perfect for focusing solely on the product, but studies show that long-form ads are more effective when they incorporate a human story. Introducing a human element adds context and makes it easier for the viewer to relate.\nIHop\u2019s \u201cAll You Can Eat Pancakes\u201d campaign included both a short-form and long-form video ad. The 6-second ad featured a single shot of the food itself, while the 15-second ad took advantage of those extra seconds by featuring three different people. No character is shown eating; we don\u2019t even get to see their faces. Yet the actors lend a human touch to the ad. Despite the age-old advice that every food ad needs a bite-and-smile moment, our analysis showed that a range of scenarios performed equally well, from ads that put chewing front-and-center to those in which no one actually ate.\nTry experimenting with varied ad lengths and creative executions to see what performs best with your brand and audiences.\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales lift, the memorability of your brand is as important as the food itself. And when it comes to brand expression, you should pull out all the stops.\nOur research shows that relying on a logo endcard might not be doing the most work for you. To make a lasting impression, think about seamlessly incorporating it throughout the ad, complemented by audio mentions, large type supers, and distinctive brand assets like mascots, brand colors, and mnemonics.\nThis Coca-Cola Vanilla ad does a great job of both subtly and not-so-subtly integrating the brand into all 20 seconds of video. The more your brand appears in the ad spot, the more likely viewers are to remember it.\nLastly, remember that the average viewer\u2019s brain can only retain so much information from any given ad. So when it comes to copy, our data supports using clear, accessible language.\nFor example, try describing the benefit rather than the ingredient. BelVita\u2019s breakfast biscuits are \u201cloaded with energy,\u201d while Special K\u2019s cereal is \u201cfeeding strength to power your moves.\u201d Special K takes the technique a step further by showing how the product helps active people, such as dancers, in their day-to-day lives.\nArmed with these five insights, your team can measurably increase creative effectiveness, making your products and your bottom line even more appetizing. Still, the best way to determine which creative practices support your goals, from awareness to conversion, is to experiment with your own ads and test them yourself."

I would like you to incorporate the following facts into it. \n- Landing pages are crucial for converting prospects into leads\n- Landing pages should clearly communicate the value of the offer and address customer pain points\n- Adding compelling imagery and videos can improve conversion rates\n- Navigation should be minimal and accompanied by a clear call to action (CTA)\n- Increasing the number of landing pages can lead to a significant increase in leads",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Today, people are spending more time online, and there\u2019s a growing challenge to hold their attention when they land on your site. When you do have their attention, it\u2019s even harder to capture their lead information. Landing pages aren\u2019t always the most popular sign-up forms, but they have the potential to accelerate your lead-generation efforts through effective design, copy, and prospect-acquisition strategy.\nWell-optimized website landing pages should convert prospects into leads. Think of it this way: Your website is like a storefront. A good landing page is a storefront window that welcomes customers by eliminating confusion and improving discoverability. Ultimately, it should convert prospective customers into solid leads.\nAt HubSpot, I\u2019ve worked with many brands over the years to optimize landing pages that deliver results. Here are four principles we use to increase lead generation.\nTo encourage the highest-quality results, landing pages should easily and quickly communicate the value of an offer \u2014 whether it\u2019s a guide, a set of templates, or a virtual event like a webinar. Be clear and avoid jargon. A well-built landing page should tell the audience what they should give in exchange for the content, how it will help solve their problem, and what exactly they\u2019ll get in return. The first impression that your customers will have of your company will come from your landing page, so it\u2019s important to think about your typical customers\u2019 fears and pain points. Be transparent by providing clear, comprehensive information up front \u2014 especially when it comes to factors such as additional fees, which may turn prospects away.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is worth a million. Adding compelling imagery and videos to landing pages helps grab attention and can help improve conversion rates. According to a HubSpot study on landing pages, 30% of top landing pages feature video content. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that imagery should be relevant and enhance the call to action (CTA), instead of driving added confusion.\nThe goal of a landing page is to have prospects hand over the desired information in exchange for the content or offer. Navigation of the page should be kept to a minimum and coupled with a clearly presented CTA to help customers quickly see the value in the page\u2019s offer and products. An action like \u201cDownload\u201d, \u201cSign up\u201d, or an otherwise relevant CTA at the top, middle, and bottom of the landing page can ratchet up more conversions because audiences don\u2019t have to go searching for the next step. Consider a personalized CTA, or smart CTA, which can convert 202% better than default versions.\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s marketing benchmarks report, companies see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. Successful landing page strategies have different pages to target specific audiences depending on where they clicked through from, and they keep each audience\u2019s motivators in mind through the entire page design. Improving relevance for your landing pages with different audiences can also lead to improved ad positioning \u2014 the better the experience your pages provide, the more likely your ads will show up in a higher position. One way to optimize your landing-page audience strategy is with Google Ads campaigns from Google and HubSpot. You can see how your leads perform by measuring key actions in the lead-to-sale journey, importing your offline conversions to understand the full value of the lead, and then using Customer Match to create personalized, meaningful landing page messages for different segments of those leads. Take the example of CallTrackingMetrics. The company synced its offline conversions to identify its most valuable leads and drove a 101% increase in marketing qualified leads.\nTo learn more about how you can help your small business succeed online, check out the new Google for Small Business digital essentials guide and the HubSpot and Google guide to Google Ads."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The marketing industry is entering a new golden age of opportunities, spurred by an unlikely catalyst: third-party cookies.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, industry leaders are making great strides to develop their \u201ccreative intelligence\u201d to reach and engage customers. Creative intelligence can be understood as the ability to customize creative without using third-party data, and then deliver these ads using the latest technologies to reach the right audiences, with the right messages, at the right times. The creative feel relevant and engaging, without the need for any personal data.\nAs we prepare for this new era in a so-called \u201ccookie-less world,\u201d here are three steps organizations can take now to build a privacy-safe creative strategy.\nMarketers must shift away from personalized ads toward a new, future-proof approach. The industry is on the cusp of a \u201ccontextual ads\u201d renaissance; these are ads that can be customized based on easily accessible information \u2014 like the date, time, weather, and even traffic conditions. This information is referred to as \u201ccontextual\u201d data, and it\u2019s been around for years but is often overlooked. These data points can play a huge role in helping marketers craft creative that is relevant and unobtrusive.\nContextual signals available to marketers\nBelgian windshield repair company Carglass recently used this privacy-forward approach to deliver customized video ads that drove impact. The firm delivered ads by using a combination of real-time data \u2014 including the weather and the streaming program a person was watching \u2014 along with first-party data about car ownership status. Contextual data about the user\u2019s country and language preference were also added into the mix. With all these data points, the company was able to serve individual viewers automated ads that were customized for the situation.\nFor example, a French speaker in Brussels watching a funny sitcom who had previously inquired about minor damage to their rear window would be served an upbeat advertisement in French, featuring rear windshield replacement and details about the Carglass service centers closest to them.\nThe ads led to an 89% drop in view-through conversion costs and drove bookings at a low cost per acquisition.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, marketers can adapt to this new creative context by drawing from a base of contextual signals, then adding in first-party data to segment audiences. Marketing teams can then go a step further by introducing statistical models to refine the clustering of audiences and predict future behavior. This allows teams to more effectively deliver relevant ads to the right audiences.\nCreative is sometimes a neglected area of marketing strategy, considered secondary to media buying and ad tech. However, Forrester research shows that shifting marketing budget from technology to creative resources can improve return on investment by up to 18%.\nTo tap into this growth potential, marketers will require both creative investment along with automation. Automated solutions can shuffle up creative assets to deliver highly relevant ads to potential customers, while saving teams precious time and energy.\nEuropean beauty retailer Douglas recently demonstrated how creative and automation can work together to deliver effective, customized ads. The company set up a campaign to reach website visitors who had provided their first-party data, and also included a wider audience of like-minded people by harnessing Google\u2019s Affinity Audiences. From there, Douglas used contextual signals to deliver ads to online pages their audiences were viewing, but they featured ads only on pages that included specific keywords.\nThe beauty of this campaign was that the company delivered these ads with automated, customized creative. People who were considered \u201chigh-potential\u201d and more likely to invest in premium products \u2014 based on first-party data and the pages they visited \u2014 were shown relevant ads for high-end beauty brands and products. Douglas aimed to improve the average order value of these loyal customers. Other audience members were shown ads aligned with their interests in either makeup, perfume, or skin care, and the featured products had lower prices. The creative assets and products were automatically swapped around to make the ads feel deeply relevant to customers.\nExample of makeup ad (left) and premium ad (right) from Douglas\nTwo animated ads for beauty products from Douglas cycle through images of a white woman modeling the nail polish, moisturizer, bronzer, blush, and anti-aging products featured.\nCreative workflows need updating in this new era. Teams need to move from a linear process to a continuous feedback loop.\nContinuous feedback loop\nThis creative workflow process involves creating dynamic ad templates where creative elements can be added and combined according to live signals, in real time. Then technologies such as Cloud Vision API can analyze visual elements and identify which approaches work best, for example, showing a person in an ad or simply showing the product. With some experimentation and testing, customer insights will build over time and new creative elements can be added into the mix and used in the ad templates. It\u2019s all about continuous, automated improvements to create the most relevant ads.\nA recent report from BCG outlines that a major airline took this approach and built a \u201cdynamic content factory.\u201d The team added between 20 to 40 new creative elements every week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, it had thousands of pieces of content to deploy using artificial intelligence into dynamic templates that combined email, web, and paid channels,\u201d said the BCG report authors.\nLuxury perfume and cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me used this approach as well, with ads built upon a dynamic template and creative assets that were automatically swapped around for improved audience appeal. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand used a continuous feedback loop to update the creative assets based on new customer insights, and these ads ultimately delivered a 31% higher click-through rate compared to static Lanc\u00f4me ads.\nThe dynamic creative were \u201ca great opportunity for our in-house programmatic team to generate actionable consumer insights,\u201d said L\u2019Or\u00e9al Germany\u2019s Head of Precision Marketing Nadine Kamski.\nThis shift toward new creative processes and away from third-party cookies could lead marketers to focus on new metrics to measure their success. While key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates are essential right now, other metrics could become more prevalent in the future. For example, engagement rates, brand lift, and return on investment could become the new standards to measure success.\nThe power of creative marketing is only set to increase, alongside the use of smart automation, as the marketing world transitions to a new privacy-first future.\n\u200b\u200b\u201dThere\u2019s so much to explore on our journey to using data creatively,\u201d says Di Mayze, global head of data at WPP. \u201cCurious data people will drive new kinds of innovation and creativity that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nWhen rethinking your brand\u2019s creative strategy, here are some points to consider."

To be ready for what\u2019s next, they need ads to drive action.\nTo explore this, Google partnered with Global Citizen to challenge ten world-class creative and performance agencies with a brief of global importance: mobilize individuals to take action for a better world using direct response ad formats across Google and YouTube.\nWorking together, agencies around the world used Video action campaigns with Discovery ads to inspire action on social challenges across health, inequality, sustainability, and education. The campaigns drove tens of thousands of people around the world to sign up as Global Citizens \u2013 a 220% increase on the average \u2013 resulting in one of Global Citizen\u2019s most successful digital acquisition campaigns, ever.Their journey uncovered 5 takeaways to get brands ready for what\u2019s next.\nTo get viewers to act, make action the center of the concept, versus relying on a call-to-action at the end. Protect the Planet leverages ASMR sound effects, visceral immediacy, and a CTA of \u201cStop this\u201d that progressively reveals throughout the ad to trigger viewer action, which resulted in strong click-through rates. Meanwhile, Advance Equity for All pairs an emotionally driven narrative with a YouTube best practice of breaking the fourth wall to deliver high average watch time and conversions per clickthrough.\nFrom striking visuals to emotional appeals, all campaigns experimented with making action integral to the storyline \u2013 driving record conversions for Global Citizen.\nSrinivas Seshadri, Director, Performance Marketing, Interactive Avenues India (End The Hunger Crisis)\nCombining YouTube and Google ad formats in an action-driving campaign can produce more efficient results than using one ad format alone. Each agency developed incredible action-driven Video action campaigns, but when paired with Discovery ads, the campaigns collectively resulted in 28% lower average conversion costs.Creating for multiple formats doesn't have to be complex. You can simply lift stills from your video asset and use them as images in Discovery ads alongside minimal copy and a succinct CTA. For all campaigns, agencies employed this approach to drive more efficient conversions.\nGeane Mota, Executive Director, Client Solutions, Blinks Essence (End Covid For All)\nGetting your audience\u2019s attention \u2014 and holding on to it \u2014 means you have more opportunity to educate, engage, or inspire. A more informed viewer is more likely to click and convert.\nAdvance Equity for All\u2019s impressive click-to-conversion ratio indicated that the longer audiences watched, the more likely they were to click through. So, grab the viewer's attention, then make sure you use it.\nWhether crafting awareness or action campaigns, the principles of YouTube's ABCD framework and Google Ads best practices remain vital. Attracting attention quickly, integrating brand throughout, and authentically connecting with audiences is essential, no matter the campaign. Once you have the attention of the viewer, be direct. Tell them what you want them to do, and show them how to do it. Campaigns with people-focused creative that address the viewer directly, like End Covid For All, perform well.\nAsking audiences to take action only works once they\u2019re already paying attention. So brands need to make sure they\u2019re making use of best practices in order to make that happen.\nChloe Stephenson, Creative Director, BBH London (Resume Learning)\nThe consumer journey is not linear, meaning that brands and agencies cannot operate in silos of creative and performance. To drive more effective and efficient campaigns, brands must break down these barriers.\nAll creative and performance agencies working on the Global Citizen campaigns partnered from the brief, through creative ideation to execution. Working collaboratively enabled campaign efficiencies and ensured all touchpoints across the customer journey were truly integrated.\nAbi Howson, VP, Video, Jellyfish UK (Resume Learning)\nWhether brands are trying to change the world or drive business results, direct response ad formats on YouTube and Google have the power to share stories that drive real action. Brands that harness the power of data-driven creativity won\u2019t only be ready for what\u2019s next \u2014 they\u2019ll be shaping what next looks like.\nWatch all the campaigns.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio.

        "output": "One of the best parts of working at YouTube is being part of the creator economy and enabling next-generation media companies to make the innovative content people love. Just last week, we announced that over the past three years, YouTube has paid $50 billion to fuel the creator economy. It\u2019s inspiring to see how these entrepreneurs are growing their audiences and businesses, while also experimenting with new tools and formats.\nTake Cassey Ho, for example. You might know her better as Blogilates, the world\u2019s most-watched Pilates instructor, who has made Pilates and wellness accessible to millions of people for more than a decade. During that time, she also became the CEO and lead designer of her own activewear company. And over the past year, she started using YouTube Shorts to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at her design process, and to share fitness tips, quick recipe ideas, and more. She does this all while continuing to post long-form workout videos daily.\nHo\u2019s willingness to innovate and embrace new formats in creative ways makes her beloved by millions. By adapting her content to be multiformat, she\u2019s also demonstrating a deep understanding of how viewers discover and watch videos today.\nThat\u2019s because people now move seamlessly between screens, experiencing worlds of content made of what they love, fueled by creators who are experts in what\u2019s relevant. In fact, streaming across different screens, video lengths, and creators is at an all-time high. Whether the content is long, short, mainstream, or personal, YouTube is the one place where people watch it all.\nHow can brands ensure that they are taking full advantage of a multiformat approach? Here are three key things to do.\nYou\u2019ve seen the dances. You\u2019ve heard the viral audio samples. And you\u2019ve probably been fooled by a \u201ccake or fake?\u201d clip at least once. If video is the breakout medium of the past few years, then mobile short-form vertical video is the breakout format. What\u2019s one thing all those short videos have in common? Creators who are constantly shaping and reacting to trends. Viewers can\u2019t get enough of them.\nSince its launch in 2021, YouTube Shorts is now home to 1.5 billion monthly active users and earns more than 30 billion daily views.1 While it\u2019s a mobile destination, Shorts also fuels discovery across formats and screens. Creators who upload both long-form video and Shorts on YouTube see longer overall watch time and subscriber growth. According to YouTube\u2019s latest Culture & Trends Report, 59% of Gen Z \u2014 the world\u2019s largest generation \u2014 agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nWhile viewers favor their mobile devices for short-form vertical video, they\u2019re increasingly turning to another familiar place for long-form online video from their favorite creators. In fact, TV is YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing screen today, with watch time continuing to level up. As of January 2022, on average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.3 The growing popularity of connected devices tells us that the old distinctions between network TV, digital, streaming, and mobile video are fading.\nSome of the shortest videos on YouTube last only a second or two, whereas the longest video on YouTube right now would take you about eight days to watch. Seriously. So what\u2019s the perfect length and type of content to keep viewers engaged?\nWe\u2019ve spent years studying and refining best practices for effective storytelling via short-form and long-form content on YouTube, exploring what makes content \u201cgood,\u201d and defining the ABCDs of effective YouTube creative. We also look to creators. Since the earliest days of video sharing on the internet, they\u2019ve experimented and optimized the length of their videos to find the sweet spot of audience attention. Because of this, they\u2019re a strong indicator of what works on YouTube.\nRight now, creators of all popularity levels are using short-form video as the latest space to experiment with new approaches and engage viewers. South Korean girl band Blackpink, for example, created the #PinkVenomChallenge on Shorts to promote the release of their latest music video, \u201cPink Venom.\u201d The group\u2019s multiformat marketing approach helped them set a new YouTube record: Pink Venom garnered 90.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the third-biggest 24-hour music video debut of all time.\nOther creators like fitness instructor GrowWithJo and dermatologist Dr. Dray have discovered that Shorts help them expand their existing YouTube channel audience and balance out their long-form content. GrowWithJo shares quick workout tips and tutorials on Shorts, inspiring viewers to also check out her long-form exercise videos. Meanwhile, Dr. Dray complements her in-depth skin care content with Shorts that offer bite-sized advice, such as quick answers to questions like \u201cWhat age to start retinoid?\u201d\nAnother way creators experiment is by giving their Shorts a distinctive style that stands out from other video formats. They might use built-in effects and filters, try different editing styles, or add popular audio samples. On top of this, they tend to use short-form video to capture content that\u2019s emotional in nature, whether delivering joy, high drama, or laughter.\nAll of this experimentation with short-form video makes creators an excellent resource for actionable Shorts-related tips. We often look to creators\u2019 learnings and insights when developing tools, templates, and creative best practices for making vertical video ads on YouTube. Here are some of our favorite creator tips for building successful Shorts.\nAs brands take inspiration from creators and experiment with short-form vertical video, they should keep in mind other creative considerations and the availability of automated tools and templates that make video ad creation easy.\nTo take advantage of this new evolution in content and user experience, marketers should think more expansively about their video campaigns and build for a range of ad lengths and screens. They can use this opportunity to break from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video ads by, instead, adapting creative assets to the look and vibe of the ad environment, whether it\u2019s in-depth, long-form video or casual, short vertical videos.\nThis combination of video ad formats is a recipe for success on YouTube. After all, adding vertical video to the mix gives brands a new creative canvas to tell their story and expand their multiformat strategy on YouTube, which helps drive the results they care about. Plus, Shorts can help brands show up alongside culturally relevant, creator-driven content that viewers love.\nMarketers should also use Shorts as a new way to achieve lower-funnel campaign goals. Because YouTube is a source of inspiration along the shopping journey, short-form video can easily help turn viewers into customers. And brands can now add vertical video assets to Video action, App, and Performance Max campaigns, which automatically scale to Shorts. Early testing shows that adding a vertical video asset to Video action campaigns delivers 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts compared to landscape videos alone.4\nCreators have been at the forefront of multiformat content experimentation, and have seen their YouTube presence and viewership grow exponentially as a result. Marketers can find similar success by studying how people move from screen to screen to watch different video formats, following creators\u2019 tips on how to engage audiences with Shorts, and using multiformat content to drive results across the entire funnel."

        "output": "Elizaveta Orekhovskaya and Artem Ryzhenkov, video advertising managers at global SaaS company Semrush, share the step-by-step plan behind their company\u2019s initiative to increase conversions with no additional budget.\nAt this stage of the pandemic, everyone is familiar with the laundry list of challenges faced by companies around the world: nervous customers, employee churn, supply-chain bottlenecks, and so on. Like the COVID-19 variants themselves, these challenges continue to take new forms with sometimes uncertain consequences.\nIn 2022, with many small- to mid-sized brands embracing digital advertising strategies for the first time, one key challenge is to break through the noise created by this shift in consumer behaviors and subsequent marketing activity.\nAt Semrush, where our business is to help brands manage their visibility on the internet, we faced this very problem as we set out to promote our own niche product with a complex funnel.\nOur customers use the Semrush platform to optimize search engine results and market more effectively online. Our platform simplifies content creation, social media, campaign creation, and competitive intelligence. Our primary goal with our most recent digital marketing initiative was to increase conversions with no additional budget. Here\u2019s how we did it.\nWe started out by investing in search and display traffic. Using keyword-based targeting, we identified an audience of users who were in-market for our product and began \u201cwarming up\u201d these potential customers with display visuals.\nThen we sought new media environments where we could drive performance without going over budget. We chose YouTube as one of these channels, given video\u2019s proven ability to create a story about a product. Our marketing team had tried YouTube before, but as we will see in a moment, its results left something to be desired.\nInitially, we set up our YouTube campaigns manually, rather than automating them. We did this mostly to understand the available optimization metrics. We launched a number of videos and analyzed them based on cost per impression, cost per view, cost per click, and click-through rate. With this knowledge in hand, our team began automating campaigns using performance metrics, such as cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate.\nThe next step was to develop a system for conversion and attribution tracking. Whereas we had previously attributed most ad conversions based on the click alone, we now added view-based attribution of YouTube ads using Google Campaign Manager.\nWith this change, YouTube\u2019s provable value as an ad channel \u2014 particularly at the customer attraction stage \u2014 was far more clear. And these placements assumed privilege of place among our other paid channels.\nOur team then tested every possible audience type, ad format, and bidding strategy. We found that custom audiences worked better for promoting a specific product than it did for a generic brand. In cases with frequently fluctuating budgets and long conversion funnels, a Maximize conversion bidding strategy proved more effective than a Target CPA strategy. And we settled on the skippable in-stream ad as the most effective ad format for its product.\nOnce the preliminary results were available, we set out to optimize our ad creatives and landing pages.\nOlga Denisova, our VP for digital marketing, observed that a better conversion rate at each stage is achieved by having videos of a certain duration, type of content, degree of complexity, and format \u2014 that is, animated or with human actors.\nFor example, at the upper stages of the funnel, we used short videos of up to 15 seconds that featured the product and encouraged trials. For lower-funnel marketing, we presented lengthier videos \u2014 up to a minute long \u2014 with more detail about a specific product feature or customer success story.\nBased on this insight, Denisova and her team began optimizing our video creatives according to the audience\u2019s phase of purchase consideration.\nOur earlier video creatives had basic graphics with lots of text but lacked voice-over and dynamism.\nWe corrected this in newer videos, focusing on more striking visuals with human actors. The CTA was also reworked for different stages of the funnel, and the video duration was optimized.\nOnce we had worked out our optimal YouTube ads settings, we set out to scale up the Semrush channel.\nBased on past experience, we introduced an optimal frequency of seven impressions per day and 10 views per month.\nFor remarketing campaigns, we based our learning strategy on the size of the targeted audience. In the upper remarketing funnel, with its large available audience of website visitors and registered users, we deployed Google\u2019s Maximize conversions bidding strategy. The lower stages of the funnel were optimized for cost per view, since the smaller available audience meant machine-learning strategies were less powerful.\nIt became clear over the course of this campaign that YouTube advertising not only delivered conversions directly, but also contributed to an increase in paid and organic search results. We saw interest in Semrush in the U.S. grow by an average of 72.6% during a Brand Lift study conducted in May 2021, while interest in our Keyword Magic Tool grew by 120.4%. Another video ad campaign in Canada delivered an increase in paid and organic Google search results of 521%.\nSince the pandemic restricted our ability to produce new video assets, we needed to improve our conversion metrics without increasing our budget or the number of video creatives we produced. To achieve this, our team used a new format from Google called Video Action campaigns, designed to drive lower funnel actions such as website clicks and conversions. As a result, the range of our ads expanded, their variability increased, and automated strategies began learning better from the increased number of conversions.\nIn Video Action campaign ads, we found the ideal palette for our new ad creatives. In one A/B test, a combination of skippable in-stream ads and Video Action campaign ads went up against skippable in-stream ads only. The combined strategy clearly performed better.\nOur CPA at the lowest stage of the funnel was 55% lower than that of the in-stream-only campaign. The cost per sign-up also fell 51%. Video Action campaigns cost 91% less, and view-through rates were 3% higher, than in-stream.\nAfter Video Action proved itself to be the superior strategy, not only on the basis of conversion but also in upper-funnel metrics, we launched the format in all automated strategy campaigns. This helped reduce the CPA per purchase from YouTube ads by a whopping 11%."

        "output": "The earliest known car ad told Scientific American readers that its product was a better investment than a horse. Today\u2019s auto brands face a crowded and competitive landscape, demanding more inventiveness. Producing an ad that really connects with the viewer can be a challenge. Creative is one tool you can leverage to make significant differences in ROI, and experimenting makes it easy to adapt and update campaigns at scale.\nTo find out what makes auto ads effective, our team analyzed thousands of auto ads on YouTube to better understand what drove performance. Based on our findings, we determined that these five creative strategies set the most successful ads apart.\nWhen it comes to the first few seconds of an auto ad, put the pedal to the metal. Opt for dropping viewers right into the action to hook their attention, over the more traditional wide running car footage they\u2019re used to seeing. From there, introduce dynamism with quickly paced, contrasting visuals paired with audio and supers.\nThe Cupra Born spot kicks off with a flash of a speeding car and keeps the momentum going by interspersing clips of the car with fleeting shots of engaging visuals to evoke the energy and excitement of being behind the wheel. The fast pace and rapid-fire stimuli grip the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them engaged throughout the ad.\nFacts and specs are important, but they\u2019re not the only things that work to sell a car. Anchoring your story in human experience allows your audience to imagine the tangible experience of the car, and how it might fit into their lives, building a personal, and more powerful, connection to your brand.\nMitsubishi Brazil\u2019s New Generation spot features women from all backgrounds literally and figuratively taking the wheel, including the wheel of a powerful new four-wheel drive. Multiple characters and a powerful storyline give viewers a reason to connect and emotionally invest.\nEngines revving, brakes squealing, tires hitting the ground: These familiar sounds create an immersive experience for viewers, an experience that becomes critical on YouTube, where 95% of ads are played with the sound on.1 Sound effects, voice-over, and other audio elements have been shown to engage people\u2019s attention and help them imagine what it\u2019s like to drive a particular car \u2014 an important consideration for purchase.\nMini USA\u2019s Hardtop 2-Door Hatchback spot amplifies the sound of the engine throughout the ad alongside everyday dialogue and a fun music track, bringing the full driving experience to life in an immersive and relatable way.\nEvery spot is a chance to show off the specs and features that make your car stand out from the rest, and simplicity is key. Ads shorter than 15 seconds are better served by focusing on one or two things, whereas longer ads have more wiggle room. The key is to keep it clear and not force too many messages at once. Have a lot to say? Consider experimenting by breaking up your multifeature spot with several shorter single-feature ads.\nFord US\u2019s F-150 campaign highlights two key features centered around one idea: making work accessible and easy, both inside and out, when you\u2019re on the road. The message is clear and simple, giving these standout features their chance to shine.\nMore than 70% of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices globally,2 so making your ad viewable on a 5-inch screen is a minimum requirement. Think bright, high-contrast colors, tight framing, and large-type supers to make your ad stand out on that small screen. \u201cBut will that translate to TV?\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve seen that mobile-first ads work just as well on connected TVs.3\nVolkswagen Canada uses bright colors and tight shots of their cars paired with large-type supers that add playful taglines to their fleet of SUVWs, ensuring that the ad is not only eye-catching, but memorable.\nUse these five data-backed creative strategies as a starting point for your next auto ad. Each tactic leaves plenty of room for your brand\u2019s unique sensibility. And once you have a strong foundation, try experimenting with different iterations of your creative to see what works best for your specific audience."

        "output": "Each year, the YouTube Works Awards program partners with Kantar to celebrate the most innovative and effective YouTube advertising in the industry. 2021 presented unique creative challenges as marketers faced the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, digital privacy concerns, and new privacy regulations. Undeterred, the brands with the six winning campaigns produced fresh, groundbreaking ideas that masterfully combined creative storytelling and YouTube. \u201cIn years past, there have been some category winners that were just brilliant video. When I look across this year\u2019s winners, everyone innovated and used the platform,\u201d said judge Colleen Leddy, chief engagement officer at Droga5.\nLet\u2019s look at four major takeaways from our winning campaigns and how they ingeniously used YouTube to drive impressive business results.\nBLK, a dating app for Gen Z and young millennials in the Black community, wanted its users to go from online connections to safe, real-life interactions. However, the COVID-19 health crisis still loomed and the COVID-19 vaccine remained a point of contention in the Black community. BLK decided to tap into Gen Z and young millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for streaming music to encourage its audience to get the vaccine. The brand launched a music video on YouTube called \u201cVax That Thang Up,\u201d which was inspired by a classic hip-hop song.\nThough the video stood at roughly two minutes in length and could be skipped, it still received over 3 billion media impressions in the first day. New registrations on the BLK app increased by 30% week over week, and first-time paid subscribers grew by 22% week over week. \u201cThey leveraged skippable and made you engaged enough to not want to skip,\u201d marveled one of our judges.\nIn contrast to BLK\u2019s longer content, travel metasearch site Kayak used quick, 15-seconds-or-less videos to address the effects of COVID-19 on travel. Using its own research and Google Trends, Kayak discovered that, even though many travel restrictions were still in place, Americans actually wanted to travel but needed the reassurance of more flexibility and options when booking trips. In response, Kayak created multiple campaigns that highlighted free cancellation and encouraged viewers to \u201cskip town\u201d instead of hitting the \u201cskip ad\u201d button.\nThe campaign proved a huge success, driving incremental conversion rates as high as 7.5% and raising purchase intent by 20%. John Deschner from Maximum Effort was impressed: \u201cThey helped you get over travel hesitancy in different ways and targeted people that were searching for these things.\u201d\nBlendJet, a blender company with a mission to make healthy food fast, easily appealed to women 24 to 54 years old, but knew it could reach a wider audience. For the launch of its new blender, the brand created a fun, out-of-the-ordinary campaign, which tapped into two wildly popular YouTube trends: \u201coddly satisfying videos\u201d and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). BlendJet\u2019s campaign, called \u201cOddly Satisfying ASMR Blends in a BlendJet 2 Portable Blender,\u201d featured a voice-over whispering clever statements while the blender hypnotically pulverized entire heads of cauliflower, chunks of ice, and more. To make sure this campaign would be seen by people most likely to buy its blenders, BlendJet focused on a custom intent audience segment, using its top converting keywords in Google Search.\nViewers ate it up. The video became a viral sensation that generated millions of dollars in sales. As a result, BlendJet\u2019s return on ad spend grew 569% year over year, and its revenue surpassed its initial target by 413%. Amanda Richman, CEO of Mindshare, praised BlendJet for turning a product demo into \u201csomething so different through the voice-over, the copy. They created content that is spot on for YouTube viewing.\u201d\nNew to the U.S. market, cat food brand Sheba needed an impactful campaign that would resonate with American cat parents. During its research, the brand discovered that cats often woke up their owners at unreasonable hours, like at four in the morning. Google Search data and YouTube analytics showed Sheba that roughly 1 in 3 people turned to their mobile phones during these moments. So Sheba created a soothing, five-hour video that used scientifically proven techniques to get people back to sleep. To promote the video during the day, Sheba released \u201csubliminal\u201d bumper ads. At night, it launched TrueView for action ads that were tailored to people\u2019s middle-of-the-night viewing habits on YouTube. A simple call to action in the ads would then lead tired cat parents to Sheba\u2019s sleep video.\nThe campaign resulted in a 100.9% uplift in brand recall and a 635% increase in searches for Sheba brand terms among those who had been exposed to the campaign. \u201cIt really was the best use of creative and media that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Traci Spiegelman, VP of global media at Mastercard. \u201cWhen you have a good insight, and find the right creative and media approach, you nail it.\u201d\nOnline dating app Tinder wanted to help the bisexual and bi+ community get more recognition and own the narrative around what it means to be bi+. It launched \u201cOnce Upon a Bi,\u201d a campaign that featured YouTube Creators reimagining well-known fairy tales based on the bi+ community\u2019s experience within the Tinder app. The brand then used TrueView for action to focus the campaign on affinity audience categories that overlapped with the creators\u2019 audiences.\nThe campaign received 3.2 million impressions, 2 million video views, and an average view rate that was 9% stronger than Tinder\u2019s previous campaign. \u201cTaking stories that have been passed on for generations and showing how they reinforce stereotypes, and using influencers and creators to tell the story was a really good use of YouTube,\u201d said Sheryl Goldstein, EVP, chief industry growth officer at IAB.\nDepartment store Target also partnered with a YouTube Creator to help diverse communities share their own stories. \u201cConvos with CEOs,\u201d a video series moderated by creator Hallease, centered on the entrepreneurial journeys of the Black-owned business founders whose products are in Target stores. Along with using paid media, Target promoted the campaign organically on YouTube by posting customer teaser content on its brand channel and publishing a playlist for the series.\nThe campaign garnered over 6.4 million views across all of the videos, over 107,000 hours of watch time, and over 20,000 total engagements on YouTube. \u201cThose convos were really rich and did the job that an ad could not have done,\u201d said Britt Nolan, president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett.\nIn a tough year, YouTube Works Awards winners turned hurdles into inspiration, reimagined content people already loved, appealed to their audiences 24/7, and gave the stage to diverse communities. They proved that a winning combination of clever storytelling and the YouTube platform can produce both viral sensations and enviable business results."

Here she explains how YouTube factors into consumers\u2019 shopping journeys.\nThe other day, my hair dryer broke.\nRather than immediately go to the store to buy a replacement, I decided to go online. I started with a simple YouTube search: \u201chow to blow dry long hair.\u201d But an interesting thing happened on my journey across the internet. I found new, related products I didn\u2019t even know existed. And, what do you know, instead of just buying a hair dryer, I bought the whole suite of products.\nFinding surprising products in a brick-and-mortar store is, or used to be, a common experience: that magical shopping moment when you stumble across something new that fits your needs perfectly. But this time, it happened in the world\u2019s biggest video storefront: YouTube.\nThe idea that e-commerce would evolve 10 years in six months started spreading during the pandemic. And while variations circulated around the industry, the concept is proving to be true: In 2020 alone, e-commerce grew nearly 30% worldwide.1\nThis summer, Publicis Groupe partnered with YouTube and Talk Shoppe to understand how the shopping journey has changed, and how brands can help enhance and expand people\u2019s experiences online. Here\u2019s what we found.\nSeventy-five percent of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration.2 This is because people have a shopping discovery mindset when they\u2019re watching video \u2014 and, of course, because there\u2019s so much content out there for them to discover.\nDue to the personalized experience of YouTube, they\u2019re not finding noise, but things that make their experiences and their lives better. For example, average daily uploads of videos with \u201cShop With Me\u201d in the title increased by over 60%, year over year.3\nYouTube is the matchmaker shoppers and brands have always wanted. You never know when a new shopping journey will begin. Importantly, this inspiration results in bigger shopping carts and upsells. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they can make a decision to purchase or not purchase faster.4\nCreators are the heart and soul of YouTube and the most tailored, personalized, shopping confidant someone could have. They are hybrids of a personal assistant and best friend, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.5\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 2021.\nWhen quality information is paired with authenticity, shoppers make confident decisions quicker, instead of leaving items in their cart while they weigh their options.\nMy daughter got me hooked on Emma Chamberlain. Twice, recently, we purchased something after watching her content. Social proof is powerful, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give them the best information about products and brands.6\nOf course, not everyone follows YouTube creators, but they can still find help on YouTube along their shopping journey. For these people, creator content is incredibly valuable, because the breadth, depth, and searchability means shoppers can find high-quality information. It\u2019s similar to reviews or star ratings on marketplaces. YouTube is a one-stop shop for the curious consumer.\nFor example, thrifting haul videos, a subset of the ever-popular haul format, in which creators share purchases that they\u2019ve made, have been viewed over 100 million times.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that YouTube\u2019s appeal as a shopping platform comes in exactly the place where brands can sometimes feel uncomfortable: It\u2019s all creator-driven, vast, and not always easy to wrap our minds around.\nResearch has repeatedly shown us that the quality of information matters more to shoppers than production quality. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they get the highest quality information about products.7\nWhen I think about these insights, I see opportunities everywhere: opportunities for brands to grow through partnering with creators; opportunities for platforms like YouTube to evolve and meet shopper needs; and opportunities to connect in new ways.\nOnline shopping is a whole new ballgame. And brands and advertisers need to adapt in this new world if they want to win big."

        "output": "As marketers, we share a common goal: Convince people to engage with our brands. Truth be told, it can take a lot of work to make this happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always struck by YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard, an annual list of the most-watched video ads of the year. In a world of unlimited content, millions of people actually choose to watch these ads, so it\u2019s useful to consider what makes them so successful.\nWhile no single formula exists for a viral video ad, we can make observations about what works to inspire our own media strategies. Here are three proven approaches to try, pulled from the latest Ads Leaderboard.\nFor its \u201cHarry Potter\u201d 20th anniversary special, HBO Max wanted to reach two distinct audiences: die-hard \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans eager to be reintroduced to the magic of the series and a new generation of younger viewers who hadn\u2019t yet embraced the franchise.\nTo appeal to both groups, HBO Max leaned into a powerful trend: people like watching content that makes them feel nostalgic. With that trend in mind, the brand designed a video ad to give viewers a heartwarming, retrospective experience full of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d memories. Beyond showcasing the cast\u2019s memorable moments, the ad pulled in fans and authentically celebrated their journey too.\nHBO Max used YouTube to power the campaign. As JP Mallo, VP of marketing for HBO Max Originals, explains, \u201cYouTube is often our initial indicator when we release early marketing assets for how our audience is engaging, what sentiments we\u2019re seeing, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re responding to in terms of content themes.\u201d\nYouTube proved to be an ideal home for HBO Max\u2019s ads, since people of all ages gravitate to the platform for nostalgic content. According to a 2022 Ipsos survey, 80% of Gen Z reported watching YouTube to feel nostalgic;1 by running a nostalgia-based campaign on YouTube, HBO Max could appeal to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d enthusiasts, while also grabbing the attention of a younger generation.\nThe campaign launched mid-November with bumper ads, plus non-skippable and skippable in-stream ads to drive awareness and consideration. Then, in the days leading up to the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, HBO Max used YouTube Select to feature the ads alongside premium content. Finally, they concluded the campaign by leveraging YouTube Masthead before and after the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, placing the video on YouTube\u2019s home feed to drive mass awareness. In the end, the approach drove 12.7% awareness lift \u2014 remarkable for a brand with high awareness already \u2014 and reached 49 million unique users.\nWE, Egypt\u2019s primary telecommunications company, needed an ad campaign that could cut through the holiday noise during the busy Ramadan season. To achieve this, it strategized videos that would help viewers understand evolving trends of Ramadan.\nSince WE\u2019s message had to appeal to viewers across multiple generations, the team determined that \u201cthe campaign should include a diverse mix of ads,\u201d says Eslam Nassar, the brand\u2019s head of digital marketing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we turned to YouTube to tell a compelling, creative story across ad formats and screens.\u201d\nWE planned and executed a full-funnel video strategy that leveraged a unique blend of short- and long-form ads. For viewers in the awareness phase, the team launched 6-second bumper ads to tease the campaign and deliver a quick call to action.\nThen, to further engage middle- and lower-funnel audiences, WE created a full-length, in-stream video. This ad was designed to be watched across devices, from connected TV to mobile. To ensure that this long-form ad could fully immerse people in the brand\u2019s unique approach to storytelling, the team relied on YouTube\u2019s four guiding principles for effective video ads on the platform, the ABCDs \u2014 shorthand for attention, branding, connection and direction.\nTo quickly gain the attention of and connect with viewers, the video began with a catchy musical track. WE made sure the distinctive purple color of its logo dominated the video\u2019s visuals to reinforce company branding. To further connect with multigenerational viewers, the video compared and contrasted Ramadan traditions throughout the ages. Finally, the video directed people to take action by signing up for WE\u2019s services so they could stay in touch with family.\nThis multiformat strategy proved successful. Within the first 24 hours, the long-form video exceeded 1 million views. What\u2019s more, its completion rate surpassed the brand\u2019s 2021 Ramadan video by 204% as well as the market average for completion rate by 47%. Ultimately, the campaign reached 79% of Egypt\u2019s YouTube population.\nWE\u2019s digital advertising manager, Ahmed Nageb, concludes, \u201cYouTube is one of most important platforms to help us execute our digital strategies effectively. Because of its vast audience, which can be targeted through various ad formats and devices, we were able to achieve maximum reach, while hitting our campaign objectives.\u201d\nLast year, BMW launched its first ever fully electric BMW iX sports activity vehicle in the United States. To promote this milestone during the Super Bowl, BMW created a 60-second hero video ad that showed Zeus, the mythical Greek god of sky and thunder, retiring to Palm Springs and rediscovering his spark when gifted a BMW iX by his wife, Hera.\nTo extend the ad\u2019s reach during this tentpole moment, BMW made YouTube a core part of its Super Bowl strategy. \u201cYouTube is a great amplifier of content, which not only increased the audience size exponentially but extended the longevity of the spot,\u201d explains Albrecht Pagenstert, head of brand marketing at BMW. \u201cWhat ran once during the Super Bowl lives online and has received millions of additional views.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s strategy hinged on reaching a wide variety of passionate Super Bowl fans through YouTube AdBlitz, the premier hub for fans to watch Super Bowl ads with playlists for the most comedic, dramatic, action-packed, and inspirational spots. Through AdBlitz, BMW could target specific Super Bowl-related video inventory, such as NFL Highlights watched by sports lovers, and Big Game Music Lineups watched by audiophiles.\nOnce the campaign peaked viewers\u2019 interest during YouTube AdBlitz, BMW then strategized to satisfy their hunger for more content. It released behind-the-scenes videos, including interviews with the hero ad\u2019s star-studded cast and director.\nAudiences couldn\u2019t get enough of BMW\u2019s campaign. In fact, many YouTube commenters enthusiastically asked for the hero video to be turned into a full movie. In the end, the video drove 17 million unique views and 970,000 clicks. In addition to being recognized on YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard in the U.S., BMW earned the No. 7 spot in USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter.\nHBO Max, WE, and BMW struck gold with video ads that entertained and engaged key audiences. By aligning their ads with popular YouTube trends, building bespoke creative for different platforms, and following the ABCDs of video effectiveness, these brands showed how to successfully combine immersive storytelling with the power of YouTube."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in the middle of a digital video boom, as alternatives to linear TV grow at unprecedented rates. According to Nielsen\u2019s total TV and streaming report, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time.1 And viewers watch a daily average of over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV devices.2\nSource: YouTube Internal Data, Global, Jan. 2022.\nThis level of engagement informs how viewers feel about ads. In a new study, we found that viewers agree that YouTube ads on the TV screen are more relevant (59%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3 Connected TV gives advertisers a powerful creative canvas to reach viewers when they are highly engaged, streaming their favorite content on the living room screen.\nTo better understand the opportunity for advertisers, these three brands ran experiments to see how effective CTV could be for their audiences. Here are the questions they set out to answer.\nOn behalf of its Ruffles brand, Frito-Lay North America leveraged CTV to engage with some of its core audiences, such as younger families, flavor variety seekers, millennials, and those living in urban areas. The marketing team wanted to understand how increases in watch time on CTV contributed to brand and sales goals.\nIn 2021, Ruffles ran an A/B test with half the media budget delivered across devices as usual and the other half with an increased allocation to CTV. It then compared performance to delivery.\nThe result? \u201cThe higher delivery to the increased CTV cells exceeded our expectations and benchmarks across view rates, ad recall, and sales lift,\u201d said Amanda Corral, senior director of paid media strategy at Frito-Lay North America. \u201cAnd we achieved this without sacrificing CPM or reach. We were thrilled to deliver a strong impact while maintaining efficiency and delivering higher ROI.\u201d\nL\u2019Oreal USA has built its brands with a commitment to consumer-centricity. Across its brands, that has meant committing to cut-through creative. (Think, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re born with it, maybe it\u2019s \u2026 .\u201d You know the rest.) It has also meant constantly refining media and audience strategies that evolve as the brands\u2019 customers do. For the past several years, L\u2019Oreal USA has followed the lead of its customers and ramped up investment in YouTube.\nThe company has honed a tried-and-true approach to creative and reach, and wanted to see how that approach scaled to CTV. So in the summer of 2021, when it was time to lean into upper-format, demand-generating media, L\u2019Oreal USA increased its YouTube investment by 102% year over year. \u201cWhat was interesting about this time was, we were seeing audience behavior patterns around ad-supported streaming and a boom in CTV that we knew wasn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d said Shenan Reed, SVP, head of media at L\u2019Oreal USA.\nThe company ran a meta-analysis across nearly 30 NCS sales lift studies and found that its YouTube activity delivered an average of 6% sales lift for its campaigns. The company also saw a 6 to 1 return on ad spend on YouTube CTV screens. Not only did this prove that L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s creative and audience strategies can scale to CTV, but it also saw that the majority of impact was coming from new consumers. That\u2019s important because, coming out of the pandemic, the team knew the company needed to attract the next generation of new consumers and first-time buyers.\n\u201cOur consumer is still in the living room, but they\u2019re watching a wider variety of content \u2014 content that is more personal, that\u2019s more of the moment. You can ignore that behavior, or you can choose to show up. And we chose to show up,\u201d said Reed.\nDocuSign was initially apprehensive about CTV, since users aren\u2019t able to click through and convert on the TV screen. However, the brand put aside those reservations and decided to experiment by using the channel to increase reach and brand awareness. DocuSign understood the importance of reaching its users wherever they were, including their connected TVs.\n\u201cBefore this test, we didn\u2019t know there was such a large audience on CTV that we weren\u2019t reaching through other video ads,\u201d said Andy Tack, senior marketing manager at DocuSign.\nBy running a CTV-dedicated advertising campaign alongside a regular cross-device campaign, DocuSign was able to isolate and quantify the impact CTV had on its campaigns. The marketing team found that the CTV ads drove a best-in-class 33% relative lift in ad recall. Furthermore, despite worries about barriers to action, DocuSign actually saw a 126% relative conversion lift for its trial sign-ups.\n\u201cWe can now clearly see the value CTV has in our campaigns,\u201d said Tack. \u201cWhether we\u2019re growing brand awareness and recall, or improving consideration and purchase intent, CTV is a critical part of our approach.\u201d\nNo model exists for the perfect CTV advertising strategy. Whether planning media on behalf of a CPG company, reaching new cosmetics buyers, or taking a chance on a new channel, brands of all types are showing what can be done. The one thing they have in common is that their efforts were rewarded."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s uncertain economy, video marketers may find it difficult to keep calm and carry on. For most, measuring the effectiveness of their media investments will be a top priority. And while focusing on measurement can help marketers fuel both short-term and long-term growth, not all measurement approaches are created equal. Success depends on having the right media strategies and tools.\nIt may be tempting, for instance, to concentrate only on immediate results during disruptive times. But savvy marketers will combine their short-term and long-term business goals and take a more holistic full-funnel approach to YouTube. Indeed, recent research by Nielsen shows that brands that added upper-funnel marketing efforts to existing mid-funnel campaigns were able to boost return on investment (ROI) by 70%. And brands that added upper-funnel tactics to campaigns that covered the middle and lower funnels were able to raise ROI by 13%.\nProving the value of a full-funnel video strategy requires using measurement tools and tactics that leverage how upper-funnel brand goals and lower-funnel performance objectives play off each other. To do this successfully, marketers can use an effective three-part framework that balances tried-and-new methods with newly emerging measurement practices. Two parts of the framework \u2014 attribution and incrementality \u2014 help set you up for short-term business outcomes, while the third part \u2014 marketing mix modeling \u2014 can help you make smarter decisions for the long haul.\nHere is a deeper look at how to apply the framework.\nThese days, using an attribution model that assigns credit for conversions to different ads that occur across the customer journey should be standard practice. When it\u2019s done right, attribution can help marketers easily optimize their ad strategies. Google\u2019s data-driven attribution model can help you analyze your customers\u2019 journey across Search, YouTube, and Display to discover which touchpoints are most effective.\nWhile attribution can help you uncover and optimize for opportunities quickly, it\u2019s important not to treat it as a stand-alone measurement solution. Relying only on attribution insights to optimize your plans may provide quick growth, but it will come at the risk of not investing in the upper-funnel branding strategies that constantly refuel the pool of customer demand. Additionally, as measurement becomes more challenging in a privacy-first world, having multiple sources of truth instead of relying solely on attribution will be critical. To take attribution to the next level, pair it with incrementality.\nOne powerful way to supplement attribution and take your measurement mix to the next level is to include incrementality. Generally defined as a lift or increase in a desired outcome, incrementality helps you understand the KPI uplift due to your ad. As a result, incrementality can help you better understand the impact of full-funnel campaigns and pave the way for longer term growth.\nThe primary way to measure incrementality is to measure the performance of your full-funnel video strategy using various lift metrics. Google offers an array of solutions to measure lift across the customer journey, including Brand Lift , Search Lift, and Conversion Lift. When combined into one unified view of measurement, Google uses these metrics to showcase the value and impact of YouTube full-funnel campaigns that span all marketing objectives to help you understand the effectiveness of each.\nIncrementality should never be treated as a one-off exercise, regardless of the outcome. Embracing a test-and-learn mindset will better position brands for resilience and long-term growth. Harvard Business Review found that marketers who run multiple tests see up to 30% higher ad performance. Once you have results in hand, optimize your media accordingly. Keep in mind that it\u2019s critical to continue gathering insights and refining your strategy beyond your initial tests. Building experimentation into your overall measurement plan will help ensure that you are consistently optimizing and refining over time.\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is a tried-and-true, privacy-durable way to measure the impact of all YouTube formats across the funnel. It is also an effective way to capture both the short- and long-term impact of marketing investments. Using longitudinal online and offline data, MMMs provide you with the ROI for each media channel. Not only should these studies be used to show how media channels performed in the past, they should be used to optimize your media allocations moving forward.\nResults from MMM studies take into account a combination of variables, so it\u2019s critical to break out YouTube from other video platforms where possible. A Nielsen study found that the return on ad spend from marketing mix models varied by as much as 48% when video platforms were individualized versus when they were aggregated together. And format-level insights provide the most actionable level of granularity, especially when it comes to a full-funnel mix. Inputs matter when it comes to your model.\nEconomic uncertainty can rattle even the most confident marketer. But adopting a full-funnel video media strategy and balancing complementary short-term and long-term measurement practices can help fuel long-term business growth. To ensure the value and effectiveness of your full-funnel strategy, marketers should leverage attribution, incrementality, continuous experimentation, and MMM to drive short-term performance and reach your overarching branding goals."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marie Gulin-Merle, global VP of ads marketing at Google, speaks at a round-table discussion about the AI revolution during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about a meeting I had more than a decade ago, when digital marketing was at the beginning of its mobile revolution. A consulting company was advising me to embrace \u201creal-time\u201d marketing. I was intrigued, but didn\u2019t think it was attainable given the state of the technology we had at that time.\nI was spending my days in the trenches with my teams and agencies. We wrestled with how to create assets across an ever-multiplying set of formats. We scrambled to keep up with trends that would ignite like wildfire, only to dissipate just as quickly. We were manually piecing together the right media mix and trying to figure out how to spend budgets in a way that delivered ROI.\nMore than anything, I dreamed of being able to get out of the weeds of digital execution to focus my attention on our customer connections, the quality of our storytelling, and our business outcomes. I just wanted to get back to marketing. But, at the time, that felt like science fiction.\nNot anymore.\nWe\u2019re all already using AI to reach our customers more efficiently. In fact, 80% of Google\u2019s customers are already using AI-powered Search ads products. Now with generative AI, marketers have a rapidly expanding set of AI-powered tools with the potential to revolutionize every single part of marketing \u2014 from how we mine for insights, brainstorm ideas, and generate content to how we connect with people, drive growth, and measure performance.\nWhen it comes to content, my biggest pain point as a marketer is simple. There are never enough people to keep up with the velocity, volume, and variations required to reach people when and where I need to.\nNow, with new AI-powered tools, my team can scale the creative concepts we love to more formats with unprecedented precision. This means more time and attention can be devoted to shaping core creative concepts. AI can then draw from this source material to instantaneously generate assets like social copy, landing pages, and emails.\nAI can do the same for ads, with alternate ad copy, automatically formatted videos, and multiple combinations of product photos, all leading to infinite permutations of tailored ads for every customer.\nAt Google we\u2019ve been using AI in our ad products since 2015. And we\u2019re already allocating a significant amount of our media spend toward AI-generated creative across Display, Video, and Search, because it has proved to be effective. There are three core areas we\u2019re focused on.\nCreative testing: Google Cloud technology is helping us use AI to score creative, predicting success or failure, before we put it out into the world. In ongoing pilots, we\u2019re using AI to help us weed out poor performers more quickly and to more easily identify potential winners. We\u2019re also working with an agency partner to apply AI to our creative asset library. That way we can understand what has performed well historically and use that knowledge to develop future campaigns.\nCampaign optimization: Our marketing teams do all of their on-stack optimization with AI. Our teams are using AI to identify the best mix of formats and placements to meet our goals across screens and audiences. Although people\u2019s behaviors are complex, reaching them across multiple surfaces \u2014 YouTube, Search, Gmail, Maps, Shopping, and Discover \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be. For example, Performance Max, our AI-powered campaign type, is driving an 18% uplift in conversions at a similar cost per action.1\nMeasurement: In response to people\u2019s increasing expectations for digital privacy, regulators and tech platforms are restricting techniques that advertisers have relied on for decades to reach audiences and measure results, such as device IDs and third-party cookies. We\u2019ve all long relied on huge stores of data to drive performance and measurement. AI is helping us use fewer signals, while driving the intelligence and trusted measurement we need.\nStill, it will take more than a culture of experimentation to capture AI\u2019s full potential. We are making sure we learn and then scale. Only then can we develop a deeper understanding of how and when AI can be deployed to augment and amplify human skills. To make this all as easy as possible to navigate, my team put together a list of AI Essentials that you can use to make sure you have the right AI foundation.\nAs we embark on this journey, what gives us confidence is Google\u2019s bold and responsible approach. AI has incredible potential to benefit our industry, but it is not without risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be responsible from the start. As an example, to address misinformation, Google will soon be integrating new innovations like \u201cabout this image\u201d metadata in Search and image watermarking. We are also using AI to deliver a privacy-first ads experience that drives results for performance marketers while also protecting consumers\u2019 privacy.\nIt\u2019s such an exciting time. The tools and capabilities I could only dream about in my days as a CMO in consumer packaged goods and retail are here \u2014 now. Marketing is about connecting brands and products to people. The \u201cwhat\u201d remains the same. The \u201chow\u201d is changing again. Marketers, we can finally get back to marketing.\nOur marketing teams here at Google have been experimenting with AI tools to be more productive and creative. Take a look."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marketers are told time and again to factor return on investment (ROI) into their media planning decisions, but putting this into practice can be daunting. It doesn\u2019t help that the media landscape is more fragmented than ever, making it difficult to isolate the impact of any given ad placement, let alone optimize for it.\nAt Google, we work closely with clients to improve media measurement and have come to recognize marketing mix models (MMMs) as the most comprehensive way of understanding ROI measurement across different media channels, spanning online and offline.\nAnalyzing a range of advertiser MMM results over the years has also helped us identify the key contributors to ROI growth for YouTube in particular. Our research shows that there are four primary levers of video ROI: creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience.\nOf course, optimizing each of these levers can look quite different from one advertiser to the next. Every marketer should experiment to understand what works best. Doing so will help them confidently make decisions around their campaigns, resulting not only in better ads but better returns.\nTo understand how each of these work, let\u2019s walk through the stories of four brands that discovered firsthand how these levers increased their ROI.\nResearch has shown that effective creative accounts for almost 50% of ROI.1 Google analysts and researchers have studied thousands of ads to understand what specific elements drive performance on YouTube. We call these elements the ABCD principles: attention, branding, connection, and direction. According to research conducted by Nielsen, ads following the ABCD principles saw a 30% higher sales lift than ads that didn\u2019t adhere to them.2 Google sales teams are equipped to help brands analyze and optimize their creative for YouTube to drive greater business impact.\nShapermint, a global e-commerce brand, wanted to both boost its brand and drive product sales. Over the course of seven weeks, it ran experiments to understand what combination of creative drove the best results in its YouTube ad campaigns. By alternating among user testimonials, product demos, and a special offer, each video had its own unique angle. Shapermint tested the impact of its messaging along with other creative levers, such as length and pacing. As a result, the brand found its optimal combination of creative, assembling a powerful mix that lowered its cost per acquisition (CPA) by 21% and drove 50% more purchases.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start by building out the foundation of your video creative according to the ABCDs, and then try experimenting with various creative elements to see what works best for your audience.\nDifferent YouTube formats serve different objectives, but research shows that full-funnel strategies consistently deliver higher ROI. Brands that combine both awareness and action YouTube ad formats as part of a full-funnel strategy see higher ROI than when using either one in isolation. Based on a custom Nielsen meta-analysis, a full-funnel YouTube strategy drives 10% higher ROI compared to awareness advertising alone.3\nSulwhasoo is a South Korean luxury skin care brand from Amorepacific. Having surpassed $790 million (1 trillion KRW) in annual sales, it is quite well known. However, it wanted to try leveraging YouTube ads to drive more conversions beyond the awareness campaigns it had historically relied on. For this experimental campaign, Sulwhasoo first used a foundation of awareness and consideration formats to maximize its audience reach. Then it layered in action formats for the first time, turning attention into action. With this YouTube full-funnel strategy, the brand saw a staggering 91% decrease in CPA and a 13.8X increase in conversion rate.\nWhile it might seem intuitive to primarily buy action formats in the pursuit of tangible ROI, advertisers will see higher returns by adding awareness formats. In fact, a recent study shows that YouTube advertisers see Awareness formats driving 28% of their conversion assists.4\nThough reach and frequency are closely knit, each impacts ROI quite differently. All else being equal, increasing reach usually maintains ROI, while increasing frequency past a specific point usually diminishes ad effectiveness. For many advertisers, this well-known rule of thumb can make them fearful of increasing their frequencies. However, most advertisers overindex on cautiousness, and, in reality, have more breathing room to increase frequency on YouTube than they might think. On average, brands can increase average weekly frequency on YouTube from one to three ad exposures without diminishing YouTube ad effectiveness, according to an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen.5\nTo simplify the process, we\u2019ve recently started letting advertisers using Video reach campaigns choose a frequency target of up to five impressions per week, helping them to achieve maximum reach while setting a desired weekly frequency. This leads to a more efficient spend and a better experience for viewers. And we\u2019re piloting YouTube reach and frequency data availability through our MMM data platform to help advertisers understand their measurements better.\nFor example, after including reach and frequency data in its commercial mix modeling program with Analytic Partners, Peloton discovered that its ideal optimization strategy was more nuanced than it had expected. The results showed that there was an opportunity to drive incremental reach after optimizing frequency, leading to a potential ROI improvement of 15%.\nLast but not least, who you show your ads to significantly affects your ROI. Every brand has at least one demographic audience, but adding in audiences based on interests and behaviors can help you reach more potential customers. For example, a beauty brand might want to show its ads to viewers who are watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or a pet food company could choose to show its ads to those who recently searched for \u201cbest organic dog foods.\u201d These nuances can make all the difference in final purchase decisions.\nThe Insights Finder tool helps marketers uncover actionable audience insights related to interests, demographics, and more, using aggregated and anonymized signals from Google and YouTube. These insights allow brands to add new audience segments and to see how their ROI is affected. Oreo used Insights Finder to break down their audience into four segments: Entertainment Fans, Trendsetters, Gamers, and Foodies. The brand created personalized creative for each of these segments and saw an impressive 100% year-over-year improvement in YouTube ROI.\nBy focusing on creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience, advertisers can better understand the contributors to their ROI. Google teams can help brands that are on this journey figure out how to optimize each of these four levers. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen, YouTube return on ad spend grew by 108%, on average, for brands after collaborating with Google, an increase that was 7X greater than seen by brands that did not collaborate with Google.6 Close partnership with our media customers is absolutely key to capturing the power of media mix modeling."

        "output": "From brushing our teeth in the morning to cleaning the kitchen counter after dinner, home and personal care (HPC) products are an essential part of our daily routines. Because these items are ubiquitous, finding imaginative ways to market them can sometimes be a challenge.\nWe know, however, that when it comes to designing ads to break through the clutter, creative has proved to be a particularly powerful tool for advertisers. Our team analyzed thousands of global HPC ads to understand exactly what kind of creative choices make some of these ads more effective than others. What we found pointed us to five creative insights about what resonates with viewers when it comes to HPC ads.\nResearch and development is how brands differentiate themselves. And while R&D is critically important, how brands communicate those differentiators is just as significant. Rather than using complex terminology (whether it\u2019s a little known ingredient or a reference to a scientific process), help people by simplifying the language or concept into a language they can easily understand.\nFor example, instead of describing technicalities, Liquid Plumr shows its benefits through a straightforward test: a universally relatable experience of a sink clogged by the oatmeal and cucumber chunks from a home-spa mask. The ad lets the viewer see the product\u2019s capabilities rather than explaining it, as one pour of Liquid Plumr clears away the clog in a single satisfying visual.\nRather than trying to hit the entire marketing funnel with a single ad, consider the creative choices that accurately address a specific objective. What works to effectively drive short-term sales goals looks quite different from ads that are focused on long-term brand equity. Ads focused on brand building can often benefit from a longer, more creative story, whereas ads focused on short-term sales and performance work the hardest when the focus is on the product itself.1\nWith the release of their new vacuum cleaner model, Bosch Hausger\u00e4te (Domestic Appliances) created a 20-second spot showing the product in action and focusing on one key feature, an approach that proved to be effective in driving short-term sales. However, when it came to creating their brand campaign, Bosch took a very different creative path. The minute-long spot featured a cast of several characters, each with distinct storylines tied together by the campaign slogan #LikeABosch, showing all the ways Bosch can play a role in our everyday lives.\nPersonal care products are just that: personal. People want to see that the product can fit into their everyday lifestyle, and being seen in that process is important. To reach all of your consumers, consider who you\u2019re portraying in your campaigns. More inclusive representation across ethnicities, ages, and genders can drive greater engagement and help your consumers connect with your brand proposition. In fact, representation is the No. 1 driver for ad recall for HPC ads, proving that integrating diversity into your ads can leave a lasting impression.2\nAll Good, a diaper brand focused on sustainability and clean ingredients, made sure to speak to all parents with its campaign. Recognizing that all kinds of families exist \u2014 whether interracial, young, single-parent \u2014 it acknowledges that many parenting struggles are universal no matter who you are. This allows viewers to connect with the brand in a more authentic, genuine way, simply by being seen and heard.\nPeople don\u2019t always have a strong emotional connection to products, especially when it comes to everyday things in home and personal care. Building that connection is vital to engagement and can help a brand stand out. Having a creative, evocative storyline that goes beyond the product can go a long way in capturing a viewer\u2019s attention.\nVeet France\u2019s \u201cYour hair, your choice, our products\u201d campaign walks through a number of poignant vignettes of various women: with a lover in bed, at a lively summertime party, laying in the grass, and admiring their arm hair. By showing a range of body types and body hair, it tells a story of the many different ways one can be a woman. A single overlying narration directly addressing the audience helps send a message about everyone being entitled to their own opinions on their bodies and body hair. Though its products are touted as a way of helping people do whatever they want with their hair, the story goes far beyond the product line.\nPeople usually don\u2019t think about what personal care products sound like, but the use of audio can evoke memories, help us more easily contextualize something, or amplify messaging. Audio is an underutilized resource in video ads despite it being one of the most effective ways to drive lift across brand metrics. Use it to amplify any visual element, like brand names or supers. Audio can also be used for product usage cues, like the spray of a bottle or the splash of a product pour.\nDowny Korea promoted its Puff laundry detergent with a short but evocative spot. When the character squeezes the puff, a sound effect emphasizes the satisfying, squishy texture, allowing the viewer to imagine what it feels like without being able to touch the product. Then, as the puff hits the laundry water, it bursts with an explosive sound. The dramatic, powerful sound communicates how vigorous its cleaning capabilities are.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why these five data-backed tactics can benefit the creative for your next HPC ad. They\u2019ll serve as a starting point for building a strong foundation as you apply your own creative angles that are true to your brand. And to really maximize your ads\u2019 effectiveness, remember to continually experiment with your creative to understand what truly drives the best results for your brand and audience."

        "output": "At YouTube, we\u2019ve analyzed the content and creators that broke through in 2022 to uncover the global insights and themes we believe will help define consumer trends in 2023. Based on what we found, we\u2019ve identified three ways marketers can take inspiration from successful creators to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with their audiences.\nThe most successful marketing shows an understanding of what motivates an audience to engage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to value online communities and understand how they can amplify and strengthen your messages.\nCreators excel at this. The top YouTube content of 2022 demonstrates how creators can inspire active engagement from their communities through moments that capture public attention. In the U.K., for example, British YouTubers Sidemen brought together audiences from many top creators to raise over $1 million during their charity football match. Meanwhile, in the U.S., American creator MrBeast made YouTube\u2019s 2022 year-end list for top 10 creators with a Willy Wonka-themed challenge video, featuring contestants from his fan base. And in Germany, the continued success of collaboration duo 7 vs. Wild can be partly attributed to their viewers, who share their takes in scores of reaction videos.\nAcross moments and geographies, viewers are forging connections with communities online that they may not interact with elsewhere. Indeed, 55% of Gen Z agree that they watch content that no one they know personally is interested in.1\nThe takeaway for marketers? Find ways to encourage participation from online groups who have specific personal interests and lean into them. By doing so, you can create brand moments with greater impact and meaning.\nIn 2022, audience interest spanned multiple formats and content categories, and their preferences often changed based on their mindset and the moment. While this trend may seem like an obstacle, it presents a great opportunity for marketers to follow the lead of creators who successfully reach new audiences by meeting them where they are.\nIn the past year, creators who told stories across multiple formats had the fastest growing audiences. For instance, Indonesian swimmer Timotius Mulyadi, whose long-form videos usually clock in at over eight minutes long, experimented with 60-second swimming tutorials, which made him one of his country\u2019s breakout creators last year.\nFact is, engaging audiences successfully in one format often means that viewers will follow you from screen to screen. Our research shows that 59% of Gen Z agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nShakira successfully capitalized on this behavior when she promoted the release of her latest song with Rauw Alejandro, \u201cTe Felecito.\u201d Instead of simply launching the music video, she used a series of Shorts to excite fans and encourage them to watch the full video experience. First, she sparked curiosity by inserting teasers from her new video into the YouTube thumbnails of her all-time classic videos. Then she released a preview of her new video on YouTube Shorts. Finally, she launched a group of Shorts that taught viewers how to do the video\u2019s choreography, which sparked a new dance challenge. This creative use of multiformat content helped her music video become the sixth most-watched in Mexico in 2022 according to YouTube Music trends.\nMeeting your audience where they are also means speaking their language, sometimes quite literally. MrBeast showed up on top creator lists in Brazil and France by using dubbed language channels. Meanwhile, Brazilian creator Jooj Natu\u2019s English-language channel helped him extend his reach into the U.S. and Canada.\nWhile marketers can take inspiration from the multiformat success of these creators, they can also engage with new audiences in a very simple and attainable way. According to a Google study, adding a vertical creative asset to a Video action campaign delivered 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts than using landscape assets alone.3\nIn the past, viral short-form videos often resulted from accidental, random moments captured on camera. But these days, Shorts are less off-the-cuff, and more crafted and intentional.\nThe Shorts that attract the largest audiences have been specifically designed to recreate the spontaneous feel of those older videos, with deliberate moments of surprise and delight. For creative inspiration, marketers can look to circus acrobat Jake Hinga, who found Shorts success by capturing him and his friends undertaking elaborate trampoline challenges. Alternatively, they can see how Chris Ivan, the king of toilet plunger trick shots, reached 80 million views by collaborating with restaurant business, Dave & Busters.\nBut Shorts don\u2019t need to seem spontaneous to be successful. Last year, comedy creators attracted audiences with character-driven sketches and parodies. Take Germany\u2019s Anna Strigl, who encouraged environmental activism in one of the country\u2019s most viewed Shorts of the year.\nThe most important takeaway for marketers is that the best short-form videos embrace the format\u2019s strength and encourage people to watch them again and again. What does this mean exactly? According to our list of top creator tips, one major thing marketers need to do is give their Shorts an immediate hook. As The Korean Vegan, a U.S.-based cooking creator, says, \u201cThe first one to two seconds are the most important. That hook better be visually, audibly, and intellectually irresistible.\u201d\nLeveraging communities, meeting audiences where they are, and creating innovative Shorts aren\u2019t just YouTube strategies. Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the way audience expectations are evolving. Marketers who incorporate these actions into their creative will empower themselves to successfully connect with the right audiences at the right moments in 2023 and beyond."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you\u2019ve watched YouTube throughout the years, you know it\u2019s evolved quite a bit. Long gone are the days when the content exclusively centered on off-the-cuff vlogs. Now, YouTube is a place that millions go to witness major cultural events. But even beyond that, people are turning to YouTube to experience the moments around these moments.\nTake me, for example. I recently watched Silk Sonic\u2019s 64th Grammy Awards performance on YouTube. Then I found myself watching video after video of related content, like Kyle Hanagami\u2019s choreography to a Silk Sonic song. I went from enjoying one performance at a major event to digging deeper into the culture surrounding that performance.\nThis type of watch behavior is ubiquitous on YouTube, and it gives brands the unique opportunity to make advertising budgets go further and work harder. Recent campaigns from Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z International are proof of this. Here\u2019s how each company successfully used YouTube to stand out, extend its reach, and increase brand awareness during a key tentpole moment.\nLast year, Hyundai planned to debut its new electric vehicle (EV), the Ioniq 5, during the Super Bowl. Angela Zepeda, Hyundai\u2019s CMO, says, \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center.\u201d\nWith more people watching live sports online, Hyundai wisely opted for a multimedia campaign. It aired a TV spot during both the NFL\u2019s AFC and NFC Championship games and again during the Super Bowl pregame show. However, in contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai went digital-first during the Super Bowl.\nAs Zepeda explains, \u201cWe know that digital-first audiences care deeply about keeping their pulse on the cultural zeitgeist, but are less likely to have standard cable and more likely to be cord-cutters. That\u2019s where YouTube came in.\u201d After consulting a Nielsen study showing YouTube as the leader in streaming watch time in the U.S., Hyundai felt confident that the platform would put them front and center with its audience.\nCore to Hyundai\u2019s digital-first approach was investing in YouTube AdBlitz inventory and surrounding its ads with Super Bowl-related content. This included videos directly related to the big game, such as NFL highlight footage, along with content tangentially related to the Super Bowl, like recipes and cooking demonstrations geared toward foodies and tailgaters. By doing so, Hyundai extended its reach beyond the mainstream Super Bowl culture and tapped into the event\u2019s subcultures.\nTiming was also integral to Hyundai\u2019s approach. The company extended its campaign to run for a full month, which allowed it to become part of the Super Bowl hype in the weeks leading up to and following the game.\nThis video content strategy paid off. After the campaign generated more than 247 million impressions, Hyundai became a big brand winner of the AdBlitz 2022 contest, an honor given to brands who receive the most views on their Super Bowl commercial. Additionally, by starting its campaign early during off-peak days, the brand also reduced its cost per unique view by 50% compared to a traditional Super Bowl buy.\nFor Pride Month this year, bubly partnered with the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, and the chosen families and safe places that allow its members to flourish. As part of the partnership, the brand created a short film called Coming Home, which offered a simple, yet powerful message: Everyone deserves a family.\nTo promote the film and ensure it got the viewership and engagement it deserved, bubly knew it was important to find the right platform. As Conor Dwyer, brand communications lead at PepsiCo, explains, \u201cYouTube was among the only platforms where we could functionally and efficiently deliver a video ad that surpassed two minutes and reach an audience already primed for viewing long-form content.\u201d YouTube also helped bubly\u2019s film reach a wider range of relevant audiences through behavioral and contextual targeting, including affinity segments like LGBTQ Content Enthusiasts, and ensure it appeared alongside relevant content.\nWith the power of YouTube behind it, the film earned more than 6 million views and a view rate above 50%. The film also drove heightened interest in the brand, which saw a 1091% relative lift in searches for \u201cbubly.\u201d\nMondel\u0113z decided to promote its Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand during Italy\u2019s biggest national music festival and song contest, the Sanremo Music Festival. This involved sponsoring the YouTube channels for the artists in the festival and running a YouTube homepage masthead during the weeklong event. The brand chose YouTube because it knew the platform would be ideal for immersing in the excitement of the festival and reaching as many music fans as possible. It was a smart strategy, as music streaming had been growing in popularity since the start of the pandemic, especially on YouTube.\nTo reach the largest online audience possible, Mondel\u0113z ran a 25% share of voice YouTube campaign, which guarantees advertisers a set percentage of ads around certain content groups. For Mondel\u0113z, that meant its campaign could run on the official YouTube channels of all the top artists competing in the Sanremo festival. Mondel\u0113z not only extended its campaign reach by leaning into the momentum from the main event, but also by tapping into the excitement before, during, and after the festival.\nMondel\u0113z also secured a YouTube masthead ad exclusively on connected TV. This helped the brand reach a new, fast-growing base of connected TV viewers and keep the Philadelphia brand front and center over the course of the festival.\nIn the end, Mondel\u0113z\u2019 connected TV masthead increased its reach by 30%, and the overall campaign successfully reached 5.4 million unique users, garnering almost 20 million impressions in just 14 days.\nAs video viewers increasingly gravitate online, innovative companies like Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z show that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply run ads during tentpole moments. Instead, these companies found wider audiences and increased brand awareness by leveraging YouTube to tap into the subculture and tangential moments around the Super Bowl, Pride Month, and Sanremo Music Festival. Their strategies and resulting success can inspire brands of all sizes to find greater reach and new fans on YouTube."

        "output": "A few weeks ago, I experienced a quintessential New York moment. I was double parked on the busy street outside my New York City apartment, desperately trying to install a car seat I had recently purchased for my 3-year-old daughter. At any moment, I knew I could be honked at for blocking other cars.\nSo I quickly whipped out my phone and headed to the Car Seat Lady on YouTube, a channel I frequently consult when I\u2019m in the market to buy a new car seat and in stressful parenting moments like this. There, I knew I could find step-by-step instructions and incredibly accurate estimates of how long it would take someone like me to install a brand-new car seat in a high-pressure situation.\nMy experience isn\u2019t unique. People all over the world turn to YouTube for help with products they just bought. In fact, they\u2019re relying on YouTube for guidance and information during every part of their shopping journey, whether they\u2019re watching unboxing videos, getting product reviews, or learning from how-to videos. This is particularly true of Gen Z, who say that YouTube is more likely than other video and social media platform to meet their top shopping needs.1\nBut what exactly makes YouTube such a magnet for shoppers? And how can brands benefit from this close relationship between YouTube and its audience? To find out, we partnered with Talk Shoppe to conduct an extensive, qualitative research study and surveyed thousands of video users in the U.S. From our findings, we\u2019ve extracted three shopping insights that can help build brand loyalty and create repeat customers on YouTube.\nYes, discovering new and exciting brands online is important to shoppers. But what they value even more is finding reliable, trustworthy information that will help them buy a product with confidence. And, according to our research, viewers say YouTube ranks no. 1 against video services and social media platforms in key shopping needs, like finding honest information and feeling good about their purchases.2\nYouTube creators are a large part of the reason why people view the platform as a source of solid information, with 87% of viewers agreeing that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.3 As one of our survey participants said, \u201cYouTubers often give updates on how the product is doing three, six, or 12 months after purchasing, and they also will warn you about things to look out for.\u201d\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, 24 markets (AR, AU, BR, CL, CO, FR, DE, ID, IT, IN, JP, KR, MX, PE, PH, NZ, NL, ES, SE, TH, VN, AE, U.K., U.S.), n=48,000, 18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 20, 2021\u2013Feb. 19, 2022.\nTo explore this further, we spoke with creator-turned-entrepreneur Cassey Ho about how building trust with her YouTube followers contributed to the success of her direct-to-consumer brand, Popflex.\nFor over 13 years, Ho established herself as an authentic, trustworthy creator and CEO by sharing free workout videos on her Blogilates YouTube channel. \u201cFans would see me wearing my products or showcasing them in the background. They started asking me for a longer hoodie or a hoodie with a bigger hood to cover their long hair. What has really helped me build trust \u2026 is that I will take those comments as inspiration to develop my products. People felt heard.\u201d\nWhen we asked Gen Z what they prioritize when they shop using video or social platforms, they ranked finding a brand they love significantly higher than finding something trendy.4 This, of course, is great news for brands who hope to become a go-to destination for Gen Z and other shoppers. But exactly how do they become that universally loved brand? They can achieve this by creating a positive shopping experience that encourages people to buy from them again and again.\nThe key to a positive shopping experience is giving people product information they can trust, which will make them more satisfied with their final purchase. And our research showed that YouTube helps brands build this basis of trust. As one of our Gen Z survey participants stated, \u201cAfter buying something that I\u2019ve actually done research on [through] YouTube, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever returned anything.\u201d YouTube also helps brands win customers\u2019 loyalty, with 85% of people who use YouTube in their shopping journey saying they have purchased or planned to purchase a brand again.5\nSource: Google/TalkShoppe, U.S., Social Commerce and Video Shopping study, n=2,000 gen. pop. 18\u201364, Aug. 2022.\nWhile shoppers trust creators\u2019 recommendations and the information they find on YouTube, can the same be said about video ads? As part of our research, Talk Shoppe conducted a test to find out how people really feel about the ads they see. They created an ad for an imaginary coffee brand and showed survey participants how this ad might look on different online platforms. Participants were then asked to quickly associate the brand in the ad with certain words.\nThe test results showed that people trusted a brand much more when they saw it on a platform they trusted. More specifically, ads on YouTube were rated significantly more trustworthy, established, and credible than they were on every other platform.6 Thus, our research shows that brands can enjoy a halo effect \u2014 positive association \u2014 from the platforms or services they advertise on, which is vital information for brand marketers who want to get the most out of their media dollars.\nThese three shopper insights can help brands leverage the implicit trust people have in YouTube and its creators. By tapping into the satisfaction shoppers have when YouTube is part of their shopping journey and by benefiting from YouTube\u2019s halo effect, brands can turn one-time buyers into long-term loyal, repeat customers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you ask a room full of advertisers, \u201cWhat makes a good video ad?\u201d you\u2019ll likely get a wide range of responses. But most will agree that good creative drives results. According to Nielsen, creative is responsible for almost half of a campaign\u2019s success.1 And when I recently ran a YouTube CMO roundtable, many clients spoke to creative customization and experimentation as key components of their success. Their experiences support the insight that relevance to viewers maximizes impact. Because different content resonates with different viewers, campaigns containing several versions of the same creative, each tailored to a specific audience, can be very effective.\nAdvancements in technology have led viewers to expect more relevance, thanks to a proliferation of choice. Now, ad creative must transform to meet those expectations. We developed Ads Creative Studio to streamline the production process by helping brands and agencies cut down on time and costs, and to facilitate collaboration between media and creative teams. Here\u2019s how two brands and an agency used the platform to create more effective ads.\nCustomization has always been a key part of PepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy, but their sparkling water brand bubly\u2019s impact on brand associations still had to be tested. The team wanted to find out how customized video ads for the brand might encourage their ideal audiences to associate it with house parties, barbecues, sports viewing, and other consumption moments. The goal? To deliver on a brief to better understand the consumer and eventually win them over.\nWith this experiment, PepsiCo wanted to gauge which of those occasion-specific messages, when aimed at relevant audiences, would resonate the most. With Ads Creative Studio, the process of building out a collection of customized assets became smoother and more efficient. The suite of tools allowed the teams to keep production internal by housing all design elements on a single platform.\n\u201cPrior to using Ads Creative Studio for video customization, we planned a high-level creative and targeting approach,\u201d said Terrence McLaughlin, associate marketing manager at PepsiCo. However, after using the tool to inventory creative variables to personalize, each with its own designated audience, they realized they had to adapt their creative process to be more tactical. \u201cAfter seeing the Ads Creative Studio user flow, we had to break down the elements of our proposed creative to mimic the framework in the platform.\u201d\nWith a single tool, the PepsiCo team was able to standardize processes across functions. As a result, the team found that campaigns with creative depicting social gathering and food pairing situations were most effective at driving brand lift. Equipped with that knowledge, teams can now craft bubly\u2019s stories around themes they know resonate with audiences they want to reach.\nWhen General Motors South America wanted to boost brand awareness of the Cruze 5 model, they decided to lean on customization beyond the basics. Drawing on Google insights, they created an audience strategy that relied on a collection of 14 different groups, including affinity audiences like \u201coutdoor enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cthrill seekers,\u201d and \u201cbeachbound travelers,\u201d as well as contextual audiences: those watching various types of auto-related content on YouTube. Each of these 14 groups would see an ad customized specifically to what would resonate with them.\nThe team was faced with the question of how to produce 14 unique ads, without sacrificing time, budget, or resources. They opted to try Ads Creative Studio.\n\u201cIt allows you to increase productivity and efficiency, both creatively and from media costs and metrics,\u201d said Gianluca Schinocca, media coordinator for GM Argentina. \u201cAmong the many benefits of Ads Creative Studio, production time saving and the large amount of videos produced are the ones that we found most impactful. We also reduced 30% in terms of costs, and, after the campaign, we noticed a huge increase in product searches.\u201d\nFor a true win, GM knew they would need measurable results in brand lift and search. In the end, with a 56% increase in Google searches for \u201cchevrolet cruze\u201d2 and a cost per view 32% less than the industry benchmark, the experiment was a success.\nFrom the agency perspective, Ads Creative Studio can eliminate the swirl that sometimes comes with ambitious undertakings. Creative agencies around the world are constantly dealing with gridlock in approvals and workflows. Men in Green, a Dutch creative agency, found that the suite of tools made it easier for designers to share and edit work. \u201cIt is the perfect solution for our challenge,\u201d said Jaap den Hertog, founder and CEO of Men in Green. \u201cIt gives a risk-free environment for designers to build [ad] creatives. It also allows for easy collaboration between multiple designers.\u201d\nPreviously, to maintain high production standards, Men in Green had strict quality controls in place that only allowed for senior designers to produce data-driven ad creatives within Display & Video 360. That meant junior designers could not create design variations, even when the team needed them. Because Ads Creative Studio is integrated into Display & Video 360, junior designers can now make their own ad creatives, halving the time it takes to deliver work and allowing senior designers to focus on quality assurance and publishing.\nTo their clients\u2019 delight, the data-driven ad creatives with tailored messaging decreased production costs significantly. When leading bath and body brand company Rituals was looking for a way to promote their Easter collection, Men in Green used templates to create personalized messages for each market. Not only did they save time and resources, but they also saw a 278% higher click-through rate, 64% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and 103% higher conversion rate compared to standard IAB banners.\nCreative is fundamental to campaign success. No matter what your goals are, a centralized suite of tools can be used to drive both efficiency and scale. By reducing barriers and enhancing efficiency, Ads Creative Studio makes it easier for teams to collaborate and create personalized assets quickly, at low cost. Coupled with video experimentation, these tools allowed three different organizations to determine the most effective story to engage each of their unique audiences."

Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, shares early takeaways from the project.\nThe term \u201ccreative\u201d used to refer to a special class within the ad world: teams with a particular skill set who often sat apart, literally and figuratively, from the rest of their organizations. But when a pandemic forced all of us into digital spaces as safe havens to work and play, \u201ccreative\u201d took on a larger meaning.\nPeople who never went to design school or drafted a creative brief got more comfortable being their authentic selves online. Unknown chefs shared their passion for cooking on YouTube and discovered a global audience hungry for more. Gamers live streamed their adventures to thousands \u2014 sometimes millions \u2014 of rapt fans. In myriad new ways and spaces, everyday people started to share their stories, and some even partnered with brands to become powerful co-storytellers.\nMarketers and agencies, too, had to get more creative in solving clients\u2019 challenges, forging meaningful connections with consumers, and measuring success. And as marketers learned how to leverage new tools for creative automation, experimentation, assistance, and measurement, they grew more comfortable sharing ownership of a brand identity with the online communities organically remixing it. Together with those communities, they remade marketing and found fresh opportunities.\nAll of this adds up to more than just a \u201cthings are different now\u201d moment.\nFor us at Google, the combination of changes in consumer behavior, the rise of machine learning, the flourishing of user expression in unscripted spaces, and macroeconomic pressures felt like an inflection point for the industry, one where creative is poised to become the last unfair advantage.\nWith automation flattening media-driven returns, creative is becoming one of the most effective levers to drive differentiation and return on investment, and creative spend is increasing faster than media spend (6% versus 5% annually between 2018 and 2021).1 Knowing that these trends deserved a deep dive, we partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 including Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 creative industry trailblazers \u2014 on what we\u2019re calling the Open Creative Project.\nThrough intensive market analysis and in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders and trailblazers, we\u2019ve begun a thorough exploration of the why, the how, and the future impact of transformational changes already underway in the creative arena. And, over and over, we\u2019ve seen that concepts that once felt oppositional \u2014 art and science, unscripted expression and brand voice, advertising creators and users, brand and performance, imagination and automation \u2014 are increasingly interdependent.\nOur goal is to spark a new dialogue focused on the role creative will play in the broader advertising industry over the next three to five years. While this conversation will surely be shaped by the contributions and feedback of the entire advertising industry, we\u2019ve already keyed in on a few areas that present some of the biggest opportunities for marketers and brands.\nA natural place to start is with the rise of the creator economy, one of the strongest signals we have of where the future of creative \u2014 and all of marketing \u2014 is headed.\nThe explosion of truly unique and innovative content the ad industry has seen over the past three years is a direct product of a global cohort of diverse new voices adding their perspectives and contributions to the traditional marketing mix across old and new platforms. Case in point: Influencer marketing payments to creators for creative advertising services grew 50% annually between 2018 and 2021.2\nThe term \u201cowned media\u201d is now a relative one. Not only does every consumer have the tools to amplify, challenge, or riff on your brand\u2019s message through their personal channels and unscripted spaces, but so do thousands of influential creators with their own massive audiences and points of view.\nAnd experimentation, the willingness to try something new or different that\u2019s so key to creativity, is fast becoming a core competency \u2014 especially with the proliferation of tools that enable experimentation.\nThere are lessons here for organizations and brands ready to break creativity out of its silo. By being open to more active collaboration with creators around a shared point of view, brands can foster a more exciting and authentic conversation with their audiences. And there is value in thinking about the \u201ccreative team\u201d as everyone from CEO to the finance team.\nThere\u2019s no question that the relationships between digital platforms and the people who use them are being reshaped.\nBut amid the noise of an internet that offers everything, all the time, how can brands connect with the right people in a way that sticks? The answer lies in the new value exchange that\u2019s redefining how, when, and why brands earn people\u2019s attention, satisfaction, and trust. It\u2019s an exchange that only works reciprocally.\nIn other words, people already understand data\u2019s value for advertisers. When people appreciate the value and benefits they receive from the data they share, the more they trust a brand to handle that data responsibly, and the more comfortable they are with the exchange.\nTo provide a convincing answer to the consumer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d, brands have to deliver empathy at scale by demonstrating a deep understanding of every customer\u2019s (and potential customer\u2019s) needs and the company\u2019s ability to meet those needs. And there\u2019s no better way to speak authentically to the widest possible audience, in the most personal terms, than great creative.\nWith all of the hats they must wear today, it\u2019s fair for marketers to wonder, \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\nBut marketers and agencies can make their jobs simpler and easier on multiple fronts by doing a single thing: embracing automation as a collaborator rather than a competitor. That\u2019s because automation and machine learning can do things that human brains can\u2019t do: connect dots at scale, uncover new insights, free up time across teams, and infuse even more creativity into organizations.\nTake the example of measurement. With so many new content formats, marketers have more data to measure than ever before. But data is only as useful as our ability to interpret and apply it, and automation is a proven tool to drive better performance via modeling.\nAdvertisers are beginning to realize this. Third-party ad technology that supports creativity \u2014 including digital asset management, dynamic creative optimization, advertising attribution, creative applications, and influencer marketing platforms \u2014 saw growth rates ranging from 10% to 30% annually between 2020 and 2021.3\nSo the shift is underway. Of course, automation-enabled measurement doesn\u2019t only make for better creative. Creative thinking can improve the ways we measure.\nToday\u2019s shopping experience extends far outside the store and into the live-streaming, social, and physical worlds.\nAnd as the creator economy flowers across augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming, brands are coming to life across a multiplicity of new dimensions. The implication for brands? Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to convert, and the entire commerce journey is an ever-expanding web of touchpoints where brand building can happen at any time.\nBrands that unlock new ways to stand out in the age of everywhere commerce will define the future of creative advertising.\nWith these ideas as thought-starters, on behalf of our Open Creative Project co-collaborators, we\u2019re excited to open up the conversation to a wider audience. In the coming months, we\u2019ll invite you to dive into a full version of the research report summarized here, followed by a series of contributions from some of the leading voices in creative advertising. We look forward to adding their insights, and more from across the industry, as we endeavor to explore, define, and invent the future of creative, together."

        "output": "Kristen O\u2019Hara is the VP of brand and agency solutions at Google. Here, she spotlights three brands piloting new approaches and stretching their thinking to capture new growth opportunities amid uncertainty.\nIn this current uncertain environment, made more challenging by conflicting news headlines, marketers may have more questions than answers. Strategic decisions tend to get magnified in times like these, and brands often respond by leaning into what they know: tried-and-true advertising tactics that deliver consistent results. While doubling down on what\u2019s familiar is better than doing nothing at all, marketers shouldn\u2019t stop there.\nSearch, video, and insights are tried-and-true advertising channels. Brands know how to leverage them to capture growth and build resilience. But brands also need to supplement their trusted playbooks with the increased insight, speed, and agility that comes from machine learning and automation. We call this combination of tried-and-true approaches and fresh new ways of working the \u201ctried-and-new.\u201d\nHaving served in a variety of roles across the industry, including CMO at Time Warner and chief business officer at Hearst, I\u2019ve experienced challenging times firsthand. Managing the marketing budgets and strategies that many of you hold right now through moments of uncertainty is the moment to focus on purposeful experimentation and lean into the tried-and-new framework. This doesn\u2019t require dramatic changes or major new investments. What it does require is prioritization, flexibility, and a learning mindset. Many leading brands have used this approach to go beyond the performance-oriented tools they\u2019ve relied on in the past to drive better business outcomes. Here are the big takeaways.\nConsumer behaviors, needs, and preferences change from moment to moment, which we see reflected in search. Among the billions of searches on Google everyday, 15% are queries we\u2019ve never seen.1\nWe know that search drives conversions. But with machine learning, you can quickly identify which new searches (or users) are most valuable to your business based on your goals. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve found that full search automation can help advertisers increase conversions by up to 20% for a similar cost per acquisition.2 This is a huge uptick when you are being asked to squeeze more value from every dollar and every campaign.\nWe can see this in action with Rothy\u2019s, a shoe and accessory retailer that relies on video and lifestyle imagery to showcase the quality and colorful nature of their products. The brand adopted automation to surface creative assets to customers at scale across all of Google\u2019s channels, including Search, Display, Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. At first Rothy\u2019s hesitated to automate such important decisions, but \u201cthe results spoke for themselves,\u201d explains Kate Barrows, Rothy\u2019s VP of growth. \u201cAutomation stays on top of customer trends and behavior faster than we can.\u201d The brand grew conversions by 60% and increased revenue by 59%.\nWhat could your brand achieve by offloading commoditized and manual tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work? When you think in those terms, you will begin to see automation as a business multiplier that scales what\u2019s working for your brand, your team, and your partners.\nRemoving tedious tasks, like manually setting your dayparting strategy or building keyword lists, enables your most valuable resource, your people, to infuse more of their own judgment, expertise, and ingenuity into the work. This may mean having the time to focus on building a strategy that expands beyond lower-funnel strategies to develop more holistic, full-funnel marketing campaigns. Or it\u2019s a chance to go deeper on your creative strategy.\nDiscovery+, the streaming platform, adopted Performance Max to improve how it optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. In this case, automation unlocked new audience trends that Discovery+ used to better refine the creative and messaging around their shows. This also freed up time to reinvest into developing a comprehensive media strategy to further drive growth. The strategy worked: Discovery+ increased incremental subscriptions by 17% and decreased cost of acquisition by 21% in a highly competitive category.\nMarketing often suffers from the misperception that it operates as a cost center. Reframing marketing as a growth driver requires speaking a new language, moving beyond proxy metrics like brand awareness or engagement to focus on business performance. Speaking a shared language with the CFO means measuring business outcomes through better use of data, technology, and machine learning.\nWhen you know the value of your customers and you combine that knowledge with AI and machine learning, your campaigns can begin to shift advertising dollars in real time to the most profitable pockets of demand. This is critical, because tying incremental marketing investments to year-over-year sales growth not only increases revenue but also reduces acquisition costs, leading to more profitable revenue. In fact, CMOs who can translate their metrics into business impact are 37% more likely to report revenue growth compared to leaders that communicate strictly in marketing language.3\nFor example, as part of its first-party data strategy, PepsiCo invested in strengthening direct relationships with their consumers by offering a loyalty rewards program that personalizes experiences and optimizes offers based on the individual\u2019s preferences. This enabled their teams to demonstrate results that tied more directly to sales, in contrast with traditional tactics like mass distributions, promotions, and broad communications that were harder to measure. For example, the food and beverage brand embedded its first-party data in its media planning and buying on YouTube. Not only did their media efficiency improve, but for some campaigns ROI increased by 3X. They also leverage this data to make better informed business decisions on new flavor testings, focus groups, and product samplings.\nDelivering continued growth means striking a balance between tested techniques that deliver consistent returns, and the potential upside of new ideas. Brave marketers have long championed this shift. It\u2019s about remaining agile to manage through the now, while being ready for what\u2019s next."

        "output": "Digital transformation is a journey, not a destination. While every journey will be different, we can learn from leading brands as they advance their digital maturity. Here, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global CMO, Aude Gandon, takes us through the company\u2019s approach to global digital marketing.\nStaying relevant in today\u2019s dynamic environment requires embracing constant change. And as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global Chief Marketing Officer, my mission is to accelerate our marketing digital transformation across the entire organization.\nAs a 156-year-old company with more than 2,000 brands \u2014 including icons like Kit Kat, Nespresso, and Purina \u2014 we believe that data and technology, along with our organization\u2019s ability to adopt and activate quickly, are key to maintaining a competitive advantage.\nPart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s success lies in how we\u2019re able to attribute our digital investments to our top and bottom lines. We recently updated our investors on our digital transformation journey by explaining how we\u2019re using data to reach and resonate with consumers at scale, and how that powers growth across our portfolio.\nIn particular, we\u2019ve identified three key areas that are critical to our success and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in: privacy-preserving fundamentals, valuable consumer connections, and ongoing experimentation. Here\u2019s how we approach each one.\nThe first key to our success is a sharp focus on privacy-preserving fundamentals. A critical part of my role as global CMO is to help Nestl\u00e9 navigate the changing advertising landscape, especially as third-party data collection phases out. By treating data protection and privacy as paramount, we've accelerated the use of privacy-preserving technologies across our organization, ensuring that our first-party strategy is future-proof. This means our brands can access high-quality data and continue to deliver personalized experiences online.\nTo drive our privacy strategy, we\u2019ve developed and delivered a global advertising-technology roadmap across all our markets and brands. Doing so has helped us take advantage of privacy features, like consent mode within Google Analytics 4 (GA4), through which we can communicate users\u2019 cookie- and app-identifier consent status to Google. Tags will then automatically adjust behavior and respect users\u2019 choices. In turn, we\u2019re able to safely improve our understanding of consumers across platforms and deliver richer experiences online.\nLastly, we recognize that staying up-to-date on new privacy capabilities requires us to invest in upskilling programs for our talented teams of brand builders around the world. By empowering our marketers to deeply understand the impact and value a technology unlocks, we can accelerate our transformation and put our company on the path to competitive advantage.\nOur second key focus is on building and fostering valuable consumer connections. In particular, our goal is to reach 400 million consumers with our first-party database by 2025. Having direct access to our first-party data \u2014 and turning this data into actionable insight \u2014 is a critical competitive advantage with immediate value for our brands.\nBy moving toward a first-party, data-driven approach and leveraging Google\u2019s privacy-preserving advertising and analytics tools, we\u2019ve increased our ability to offer personalized solutions in real time, track ROI, and improve sales performance. This ultimately helps us make smarter investments, especially amid economic uncertainty, when it is more critical than ever to understand the value of media spend.\nOne powerful example of this is our food brand Maggi\u2019s use of first-party data to inform dynamic ad creative and better connect with consumers in the Middle East during seasonal moments and other special occasions. By taking this approach, the Maggi team improved its return on ad spend by 25%.\nAnother example is how we leverage new audience capabilities to derive value from our first-party data. Solutions such as Google\u2019s advanced look-alike modeling, currently available in beta, gives us more transparency and control when building audience segments by combining our first-party data with Google\u2019s consumer intent signals. Already, this technology has improved our media efficiency and helped drive a 25% uplift in ad recall for one of our pet care brands in the U.K.\nOur final key focus is on experimentation and fostering a culture of experimentation across our marketing teams. To do this, we lean heavily on cloud capabilities that give us the flexibility to try new technologies while strengthening consumer privacy and growing our first-party data. Our \u201cCloud-in-a-Box\u201d program, for example, gives our brands scalable blueprints to unlock the value of machine learning and other predictive technology.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice for our market-leading Nescaf\u00e9 coffee brand in Thailand. Using Cloud-in-a-Box, the Nescaf\u00e9 team routed large volumes of past campaign data to Google Cloud, then used machine learning to predict which creative messages paired with which audiences to deliver the best results on YouTube.\nBy taking this approach, Nescaf\u00e9 improved its cost per view by 17% and invested the money it saved to reach additional audiences, all while boosting ad recall 12%. Most importantly, the team saw up to 90% accuracy in the model\u2019s predictions, when compared with outcomes from the actual campaign.\nBuilding brands that consumers love remains our core marketing ambition. Our continued investment in digital transformation focuses us on understanding and using the power of data and technology to fuel growth potential for tomorrow.\nBy driving a consistent global marketing strategy across the organization, our team has been able to drive change at scale, embracing data and technology to build competitiveness. Our strategic priorities are helping us build resilience through uncertainty, positioning Nestl\u00e9 to achieve long-term growth."

        "output": "Changes are afoot in how people spend their money. Consumers are being more intentional with purchases, making fewer impulse buys, considering more brands, and exploring multiple commerce platforms. Businesses need to move quickly to keep up with this swerve in shopper mindsets, but it can be hard to put change into action amid uncertainty.\nFinding the right balance between tested strategies and emerging tech innovations can revitalize marketing approaches and power long-term growth. At Google, we call this the tried-and-new approach. It\u2019s about doubling down on proven tactics while leaning into new technology to drive success.\nWhat does this look like in practice? We\u2019ve identified a few strategies that position businesses to adopt the tried-and-new, along with examples of two innovative companies that are using Google\u2019s tools to pivot their growth marketing strategy.\nPeople spend more time researching purchase decisions than they once did, and they\u2019re conducting this research across a growing array of platforms. With this change, automation tools have become a critical way for brands to meet their customers across these digital touchpoints.\nA good example of this comes from Est\u00e9e Lauder in Thailand. Despite being one of the world\u2019s largest cosmetic brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder was challenged to keep up with customer search demand as new search queries and keyword combinations emerged daily. People were no longer just searching for terms like \u201cserum,\u201d but new specific searches like \u201cbest serum for the best price\u201d and \u201cbest serum for brightening skin.\u201d\nThe company decided to approach the problem using automation. To capture and convert prospective customers at scale, Est\u00e9e Lauder used Google\u2019s broad match to automate identification of consumers\u2019 keyword searches to make their ads more relevant to prospective customers. The company also adopted Dynamic Search Ads to find exactly what consumers were searching for on Google and used that data to target their ads and fill gaps in their keyword-based campaigns.\nAs a result, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s media performance shot up. Compared to traditional branded keyword campaigns, the company experienced a 15% increase in return on ad spend, a more than 16% rise in conversion value, and an 11% lift in average purchase size.\nKnowing how to reach the most valuable customers and others like them at scale is a powerful growth multiplier. Using automated solutions allows businesses to do this, while controlling what they pay for customer acquisition and tailoring messages to attract customer attention.\nMarketers know they need to measure what matters, but what are the most important metrics when the economic outlook is in flux? Uncertainty signals the need to move beyond traditional proxy marketing metrics and toward the measurement of real business outcomes.\nArizona State University (ASU) had a business goal to enroll more online students for the 2022\u20132023 school year than the year prior \u2014 no small aim given years of declining enrollment across U.S. postsecondary institutions.\nTo drive this outcome, ASU partnered with Google data scientists to use advanced automation solutions in combination with first-party data to identify people who were most likely to enroll at the institution.\nBut ASU needed to embrace new measurement in order to track the results of these solutions and track progress against its goal. The university leaned in to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and adopted Google Tag Manager\u2019s (GTM) server-side tracking. This allowed ASU to measure the results of its first-party targeting, resulting in a 10% increase in observable conversions on its site and an 8% increase in the on-page conversion rate. Adopting GTM tagging also drove a 25% improvement in page load time and 18% improvement in search engine results page position.\nThis increase in conversions drove remarkable impact. For the 2022 fall semester, ASU Online increased enrollment by 6.9% compared to 2021, setting a record for incoming students.\nNew automation solutions handily harnessed the scale of platforms, helping ASU reach the people who were most likely to act at lower cost. And it was able to measure and track this progress in real time using privacy-safe solutions within GA4.\nPreparing for what\u2019s next is always daunting \u2014 and all the more during times of rapid change.\nBut new marketing strategy tools available today can help to augment traditional strategies, deliver reliable results, and drive long-term growth, no matter what disruptions surface. Use the tried-and-new and make your marketing go further."

        "input": "",
        "output": "People encounter more sustainability-related brand messages than ever, and with good reason: According to a recent Harris Poll survey sponsored by Google Cloud, the vast majority (85%) of executives acknowledge that customers are more likely to engage and do business with sustainable brands. Brand commitments to sustainability have proliferated, with sustainability marketing strategies amplifying those commitments \u2014 on food packaging, in car ads, even on energy bills. That means people see a ton of messages about the environment throughout the day. Those messages represent many opportunities to appeal to customers\u2019 values. How they are conveyed is critical to building brand trust.\nWe asked more than 3,000 Americans of different backgrounds to tell us about sustainability messaging that did not resonate with them to get a better understanding of how to connect on this important issue. Using a type of AI called natural language processing, we clustered and analyzed thousands of opinions by theme to identify how people felt about certain visuals, copy, and creative approaches. Here are three of the most common sustainability marketing pitfalls our research revealed.\nU.S. survey respondents knew which parts of their day-to-day consumption were environmentally unsustainable, citing things like plastic use and driving, but they expressed frustration when they couldn\u2019t afford to change their habits.1\n\u201cI wanted to start using compostable and plastic-free products but could not afford them.\u201d\n\u201cI feel helpless when considering the impact of fossil fuel consumption. I can\u2019t help driving my car when I need to.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to buy an EV, but cannot afford it. I would also like solar panels, cannot afford those either.\u201d\nEducational campaigns can have limited or negative impact when they become constant reminders of barriers to change. Awareness of a sustainability-related problem is rarely the sole cause of inaction. Many people today understand their environmental impact and want to do something about it, but not everyone is in a position to opt into a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, paper straws, though better for the environment, are not universally accessible. Walking or taking the bus to work isn\u2019t always feasible. Meanwhile, some sustainable options can be hard to find or more expensive than the default.\nTo avoid this pitfall, highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are also cost or timesaving. Such \u201cco-benefits\u201d of climate action enable people to make the best choices for their own specific sets of circumstances. Case in point: Google Maps now shows the most fuel-efficient routes, which are often the fastest. Interest in fuel efficiency has grown globally over the past year.2 By integrating sustainability into existing products, brands can enhance people\u2019s lifestyles, rather than interrupt or criticize them. Social proof is a powerful motivator, but research shows people underestimate just how many others are taking environmental action. To remedy this, we created a website for Earth Day that highlights climate actions that have gained traction over the last few years and a variety of steps people can take toward adoption.\nWhile dramatic images of destroyed environments may emphasize the urgency of global action, they may also be overwhelming to individuals. When asked to describe \u201cactions or attitudes that could make people feel bad about their impact on the environment,\u201d many U.S. survey respondents pointed to images of landscapes ruined by trash, fires, or pollution, while some pointed to images of animal suffering.3\nDepicting the severity of an issue through poignant creative is a common way to engage people in a cause. Conveying the size of the problem with great urgency should, in theory, motivate people to act. While this may be effective for certain causes, it can sometimes be detrimental to others. Illustrating a massive phenomenon like climate change can easily overwhelm people and decrease feelings of individual efficacy.4\n\u201cI\u2019m only one person. I can\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing pictures and videos of the giant garbage pile in the ocean that is now bigger than the state of Texas ... made my stomach hurt. But I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI always feel bad when I see the changing climate\u2019s effect on animals. \u2026 I feel a little helpless.\u201d\nBrands and companies still have a place when it comes to helping people make positive changes in their daily lives. They just have to put those contributions in context. Rather than depict the harrowing consequences of inaction, focus instead on concrete, small-scale actions that add up to visible improvements. Even one-time changes that lessen impact over time \u2014 such as replacing light bulbs with LEDs \u2014 can empower customers to participate.\nConsider using before-and-after visualizations that show the value of individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 combined efforts. Time-lapse videos can illustrate outcomes in powerful ways. Such visuals show that we haven\u2019t gone past a point of no return and that measures to address the problem can still be effective. Reporting an initiative\u2019s success to date can also make people want to be a part of the solution.\nPeople may react negatively to being told what to do by brands. This type of purpose-driven advertising can be met with skepticism, with some viewing it as greenwashing. Many U.S. survey respondents pointed to insufficient evidence as a barrier to believing a company\u2019s sustainability claims.5\n\u201cMost of the time [sustainable messaging] is just greenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they can show proof [of] what they\u2019re doing to protect the environment, I don\u2019t fully believe it.\u201d\nThe sentiments align with results from a global survey of top-level executives that had nearly 6 out of 10 (59%) admitting to overstating \u2014 or inaccurately representing \u2014 their sustainability activities. Reporting hard metrics can be an effective inoculation against exaggeration. If you are able to substantiate the value of your offerings, those who care about the cause might consider your proposition. At the very least, they might do some research on their end to learn more about your brand and its climate action goals.\nEffective sustainability marketing and messaging is all about delivering reliable information to help people make better choices in the context of their lives. It\u2019s also about unearthing essential data so that people can gauge and compare the impact of different offerings. For retailers, this might mean introducing features that highlight brands carrying Energy Star-certified products, allowing shoppers to filter for energy-efficient options with a single click.\nThe climate crisis is an urgent matter and individual changes to our lifestyles and behavior have an impact. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve \u201cglobal net-zero\u201d by 2050 are linked to consumer choices.6\nWhile businesses and governments have an opportunity to lead the charge, they also have a critical role to play in making sustainable living more accessible and inclusive for all \u2014 by considering the multifaceted lives of customers who are already well aware of the changes they want to make."

        "output": "Kelsey Davis, founder and CEO of Cllctve, a global community portfolio platform that helps brands discover and connect with creators, shares how Black creators are at the forefront of the shifting content landscape, and how brands can credit Black creativity beyond Black History Month. Davis has been featured as a next-gen leader in Forbes 30 Under 30, Adweek, and The New York Times, and is a recipient of the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund.\nGrowing up in Atlanta, I\u2019ve always been interested in the ways business and media converge, especially when it comes to Black culture. Studying video production in high school led me to make so many short films for the Y that they hired me as a freelancer. Local projects like these gave me more visibility and credibility in my community as a video producer. A friend helped me land my first gig with a Fortune 500 brand as a video producer for the Raurfest music festival. The success of the festival led to a meeting with executives at festival sponsor Coca-Cola to talk about my vision for future projects.\nAfter scaling productions early in Atlanta, I started studying film and entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. By my sophomore year, I had traveled the country working on creative projects with major brands, like Puma, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Land Rover, juggling high-profile projects with being a full-time student, finding a job, and building my personal brand as a freelance content creator. It was overwhelming, but I soon realized I was not alone. Many talented students wanted to build their portfolios and monetize their craft. They just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nI saw an opportunity to simplify the gig-finding and on-ramping processes so that young creators could turn their hobbies and passions into careers. From working with marketers, I knew that giving brands a way to discover and manage creator partnerships in one place could be game-changing. That\u2019s what led me to launch Cllctve, a portfolio platform that connects creators with their next opportunity and helps brands easily find and connect with Gen Z voices.\nThe content landscape is changing rapidly, and streaming is at the forefront. Digital video content is much more accessible to consumers, with a range of video lengths, types of content, and production quality. Over the past five years, there\u2019s been a significant rise in digital video-on-demand content as more consumers become creators of content as well. The more tools platforms give people to express themselves, the more content people will create, including branded content. Platforms like YouTube exemplify the cyclical relationship between consuming and creating content.\nThis is the age of the creator economy. At Cllctve, we believe that every human is a creator. We imagine a future where everyone has access to the tools, resources, and network to create the life they want. While many monetization avenues continue to grow, 77% of creators still depend on brand deals for revenue. And brands are looking for talent to help them produce their next campaigns.\nHistorically, Black creators have been among the leading spheres of influence driving the content economy forward. Whether it\u2019s through the storytelling of legendary writers like Toni Morrison, the choreography of revolutionary artists like Alvin Ailey, or the countless innovators of collective movements across genre and craft, Black creators have always achieved their creative visions by using their gifts to create through media that reaches the masses. 2015 proved to be a tipping point, when consumer data caught up to producer impact, and the results showed the influence of Black creators on the content landscape in real time. Black people are also some of the fastest to adopt streaming services. To move into representation beyond Black History Month, brands need to expand the types of Black talent they feature, pay Black creators equitably, and credit them for their contributions.\nBrands need to scout early and often for Black talent, expanding their search to places and people that are often overlooked. The increase in creator-economy activity nationwide gives brands the opportunity to look outside the traditional markets of New York and Los Angeles for talent. Given that the media has the potential to influence so much of how we see ourselves, brands need to expand representation beyond celebrities to emerging creators who deserve to be known. While it can feel more comfortable to reach out to the same circles, it\u2019s important for marketing teams to go beyond the usual roster to find young, diverse talent. Cllctve helps them find this talent by giving Gen Z creators a way to be discovered by brands trying to connect authentically with young audiences. One of the creators on our platform is based in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been able to work with local and national brands to produce content for them remotely, while staying close to his family.\nCompensation is a critical part of hiring the best talent, yet it\u2019s too often overlooked. The creator-economy wage gap between Black and white workers is disheartening, at 35%. This shows that when brands do decide to hire Black creators, it\u2019s at a significantly lower price point than their white counterparts. Even though the data shows that Black viewership is a leading driver of growth, the value these companies choose to invest in Black creators betrays a willingness to profit from Black art while underpaying Black artists.\nThe key to closing this gap is transparency. At Cllctve, we talk openly about how creators can think about pricing, and we encourage our creators to post their rates on their profile so there are no surprises when they connect with brands. We also provide prompts to help both brands and creators start the conversation. It\u2019s important to me that creators have the tools and resources that they need to feel empowered, and that brands know as much information upfront to streamline conversations. That way, everyone gets value out of the partnership.\nFinancial compensation is important, but so is crediting and celebrating Black creatives. Giving credit can look different depending on the project. Often it means using your platform to elevate Black creativity. One brand that actively seeks to credit both Black creators and Black businesses is Target. In a recent series called Convos with CEOs, Target partnered with YouTube Creator Hallease to highlight the stories behind the CEOs of four different Black-owned brands at Target. With over an hour of original content, the campaign garnered 6.4 million views, 20% higher than benchmarks.\nWhile it\u2019s great to use February as a time to prioritize these initiatives, investing in broad and systemic representation of creators should be a year-round effort. To make good on promises to drive equity, brands must embed it into the DNA of their businesses. And that means scouting, paying, and crediting Black creators."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Brands are embracing multiformat video as a key marketing strategy, whether they\u2019re exploring how personal relevance influences watching habits across formats or thinking like creators and experimenting with short- and long-form content. And with 80% of viewers agreeing that YouTube offers the largest variety of video content compared to any other platform,1 brands are turning to the platform to bring their campaigns to life across different formats and environments.\nSource: Google/Kantar, U.S., YouTube U.S. Hero Claims 2022, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop viewers of video content min. once/week, fieldwork completed in Q1 2022.\nWhile multiformat success often means matching your creative asset with the right screen and content type, it\u2019s also critically important to use video formats that are geared toward your marketing goals. Here, we\u2019ll break down what this means in practice by looking at three case studies about brands that combined multiple video formats with cutting-edge creative to drive powerful results.\nNissan wanted to build awareness and excitement for its all-new, all-electric vehicle, Ariya, in a thrilling way. Knowing that music offers a deeply personal, yet universal, experience, the brand dreamed up unique ways to leverage the art form. Since YouTube offers a breadth of ways for music fans to tap into their passions, the marketing team tapped into the platform to reach engaged audiences.\nTo fully demonstrate Ariya\u2019s duality \u2014 that of a serene, Japanese-inspired cabin combined with the thrilling torque of an electric vehicle \u2014 Nissan opted to experiment with YouTube\u2019s popular lo-fi trend, consisting of music videos with chill hip-hop beats and stripped-back production.\nInspired by a popular creator called Lofi Girl, Nissan created its own four-hour lo-fi video, complete with a 15-track playlist and whimsical animation. While creating hourslong content might be considered risky, Nissan felt confident that YouTube viewers would be receptive. As Allyson Witherspoon, Nissan\u2019s global CMO, explains, \u201cIn launching the all-electric Ariya, we looked to build awareness and consideration in ways that could match the vehicle in being exceptionally creative, unique, and trend-leading. That\u2019s where YouTube came in. It gave us the creative canvas to innovate and authentically connect with our audience.\u201d\nNissan ran its lo-fi video across screens using skippable in-stream ads to drive efficient reach, along with a roadblock on Lofi Girl\u2019s channel to increase the video\u2019s share of voice. The team also used a diverse mix of music lineups to surround the campaign with related content, engage new audiences, and meet passionate music lovers already primed for listening across screens.\nIn its first month, the video drew over 7 million views and thousands of positive comments. It earned an impressive average watch time of 15 minutes across all devices, and 19 minutes on connected TV (CTV) specifically. The campaign\u2019s impact proves that with the right creative, the right trend, and the right platform, even the longest-form content can engage audiences across screens.\nInternational fitness brand Les Mills had the goal of increasing sign ups for its Les Mills+ at-home fitness app. To achieve it, the brand sought to make exercise \u2014 an intimidating concept for many consumers \u2014 feel more accessible. This made short, made-for-mobile video the ideal format. And, with YouTube Shorts averaging over 50 billion daily views (as of January 2023),2 Les Mills put Shorts at the center of its plan.\nFor ad creative, the brand repurposed short-form, vertical video content previously developed for social media. Next, the Les Mills team ran a mix of vertical and horizontal Video action campaigns to encourage lower-funnel audiences to sign up for the Les Mills+ app. This approach ensured that viewers would receive the most suitable aspect ratio, regardless of device.\nUltimately, the campaign exceeded expectations by generating a 52% increase in click-through rate, while reducing cost; Les Mills saw a 10% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 16% decrease in cost per impression. And, while people tuned in on a variety of devices, 24% of impressions were generated from views on mobile phones, supporting the team\u2019s strategy to build with mobile in mind.\nAs Michael Fitzpatrick, marketing manager at Les Mills, explains, \u201cIncorporating vertical video has enabled us to reach incremental audiences during their different watch states and, ultimately, drive more people to work out with us on Les Mills+.\u201d His team\u2019s successful approach shows that using multiple formats helps marketers meet customers where they\u2019re consuming content and drive the results they seek.\nFor centuries, winery brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has been known for its prestigious, high-end Champagne. More recently, however, the company has sought to increase brand desirability by expanding its core audience. For the marketing team, this meant a rejuvenation of brand content, with a modern twist. Taking a cue from the popular how-to trend on YouTube, they created The Perfect Serve, a tutorial series aimed at making Champagne culture appeal to a new generation.\nThis series included long-form videos, along with shorter, bite-sized teaser videos. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s creative best practices, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon designed its shorter videos to run as attention-grabbing in-stream ads to attract viewers to its \u201cThe Perfect Serve\u201d YouTube playlist.\nWith creative assets ready, the team considered screens. Since reaching people in multiple watching environments was important, they made a bold choice to run two different campaigns; one meant for viewers specifically streaming YouTube on their CTVs and another that focused on all other devices.\nWhile the two campaigns used the same creative assets, the CTV campaign helped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon marry its engaging tutorials with a screen designed to be immersive and proved to be effective. According to our recent study with Latitude, viewers agree that ads on YouTube CTV are more relevant (59%), unique (55%), informative (52%), and enjoyable (51%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3\nBoth campaigns performed exceptionally well, but the CTV effort was the most successful with viewers. Compared to the campaign targeting other devices, it drove more than double the ad recall, demonstrating how brands can use CTV to bolster their media strategies and connect with passionate audiences.\n\u201cThe emergence of CTV on YouTube shows us how message and format are intrinsically linked,\u2019\u2019 says Karen Valesella, digital marketing and communications director at Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u2018\u2019Whether it\u2019s very short or very long formats, YouTube offers us a wide range of possibilities to meet all our needs.\u201d Citing its impressive results, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has incorporated CTV into the brand\u2019s broader strategy.\nNissan took a chance on a four-hour lo-fi video to drive excitement for its electric vehicle, while Les Mills successfully increased sign-ups with short-form fitness content. And Mo\u00ebt & Chandon experimented with different formats to boost their brand appeal, ultimately striking gold with their CTV campaign. These campaigns proved how multiformat videos on YouTube can help brands tell their stories and reach the world\u2019s largest video-viewing audience at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way."

        "output": "YouTube is the top streaming destination for viewers of all generations. Senior leaders from media agency Carat share how brands should approach the platform to connect with audiences and drive results.\nAs people of all generations spend less time watching TV1 and more time online,2 it\u2019s increasingly clear that YouTube is now their top choice among streaming and social platforms.3\nViewers come to YouTube for many reasons: to immerse themselves in their favorite worlds through deep-dive content, to catch a new video from their favorite creator, or to find in-depth commentary and analysis. A top reason audiences tune into the No. 1 most-watched streaming platform in America4 is to rewind relevant events5 and discover thoughtful perspectives in a media environment that sometimes sacrifices depth for velocity. This is according to recent research on viewer trends from media agency Carat, youth culture agency Archrival, and Google.\nThis same study demonstrated two other noteworthy insights. First, audiences appreciate having the agency to search for and choose YouTube videos that bring them joy.6 They\u2019re not just passing time watching the latest trends served up on social media. Instead, they consider the minutes and hours on YouTube to be time well spent. Second, a majority of viewers agree that creators are the reason they visit YouTube. This is especially true of Gen Z.7\nThese insights reinforce YouTube\u2019s indispensability to users and present a huge opportunity for advertisers to increase engagement with their audiences. For more on YouTube\u2019s place in viewers\u2019 lives and its significance to advertisers, we asked three agency executives from Carat to share their perspective on how brands can make the most of the unique engagement and relevance that YouTube offers.\nYouTube enables us to place people at the heart of our media approach. The platform offers powerful opportunities for brands to understand the behaviors, preferences, and cultural trends of their target audiences and then use those insights to map consumer journeys and optimize campaign performance at every stage.\nWe know, for instance, that YouTube has unparalleled influence among Gen Z viewers and that 68% of Gen Z audiences agree creators are why they keep returning to YouTube.8 This creator-driven content lets brands establish authentic connections with their audiences, inspire action, and achieve sustained growth.\nYouTube is a launchpad for myriad ideas, making it a valuable platform for brands. Users trust YouTube to provide answers and inspiration; it\u2019s the starting point and endpoint of their online experience.\nYouTube\u2019s large creator community and crowdsourcing aspects contribute to the wealth of content available and provide diverse opportunities for consumer engagement. By tapping into thoughtful perspectives, curating time well spent, and fostering creator connections, we guide brands to make the most of YouTube\u2019s unique engagement and opportunities for relevance. We ensure that brands show up where viewers have always been watching, reflecting what truly matters to them.\nPeople go to YouTube to engage with topics they are passionate about and search for different perspectives. Core users will go even deeper than casual users, journeying through the platform for a variety of opinions. YouTube is not just entertainment for them; it broadens how they see the world and think about key issues.\nYouTube\u2019s role in the media ecosystem has started to shift. As connected TV has started to feel more traditional and social media has become unpredictable, YouTube now seems to sit in a sweet spot between the two. YouTube offers users more control and searchability than social platforms, but the content still feels fresh, unconstrained by the rigid formats associated with TV. Brands should lean into these strengths. By doing so, they can still drive reach within topics of interest, maintain the freedom to play with format, and offer unique perspectives audiences can\u2019t get elsewhere."

        "output": "The final weeks of the year provide a natural opportunity to reflect on the world around us and plan for the future. As 2021 has been another year of change driven by disruptive external events, the year\u2019s top videos \u2014 viewed by 2 billion people across more than 100 countries \u2014 reflect that reality.\nYouTube\u2019s Culture and Trends team reviewed the top videos from creators from around the globe and saw three themes emerge \u2014 community, comfort, and creativity \u2014 that offer a glimpse into what people are watching and what 2022 might hold. Together these themes not only encapsulate where we are today, but speak to broader shifts in society. From a marketing standpoint, these global insights can help brands understand what people are looking for and how best to reach them.\n\u201cGaming\u201d used to be a subculture, but with 2.9 billion people expected to play video games by the end of this year, today it\u2019s clearly pop culture. The $175 billion industry also has a diverse consumer base, with women making up 46% of gamers and 10% of gamers identifying as LGBTQ+.\nGaming\u2019s primacy is reflected in this year\u2019s Top 10 lists. Players from around the world have taken gaming to the next level, using game elements to craft narratives that spark viewer obsession akin to a must-see TV series. YouTube\u2019s most viewed game, \u201cMinecraft,\u201d featured prominently in two of the top trending videos, receiving more than 100 million combined views. YouTube\u2019s most viewed new game, a rhythm game called \u201cFriday Night Funkin\u201d that\u2019s reminiscent of early 2000s craze \u201cDance Dance Revolution,\u201d made the list with an entry from Cory Kenshin. And speaking of nostalgia, another dominant video, Game Night Stereotypes from top creators Dude Perfect, hilariously portrays a cast of characters often encountered playing board games.\nSource: Newzoo, Global Games Market to Generate $175.8 Billion in 2021; Despite a Slight Decline, the Market Is on Track to Surpass $200 Billion in 2023, May 6, 2021.\nFor many creators and viewers, engaging with game content offers a way to engage with each other, whether through live streaming or on their own time. With the huge cultural zeitgeist around gaming, marketers are finding creative ways to tap into this community. Nintendo debuted its new OLED model, highlighting different games and ways to play, earning a spot on the 2021 end-of-year YouTube ads leaderboard. Among other brand integrations, Balenciaga collaborated with Fortnite, Lil Nas X performed for Roblox, and Puma and ColourPop partnered with Animal Crossing.\nThe past two years have been defined by global political and social instability with little ability to guess the future beyond next week. Perhaps in response to this extended period of uncertainty, people around the world engaged in comfort viewing by seeking out the familiar.\nFor instance, some of this year\u2019s top trending videos from around the world are newer versions of videos that previously resonated with viewers. Back by popular demand, Sidemen created a third installment of their \u201cTinder in Real Life\u201d series, while Mark Rober reprised his 2020 backyard squirrel maze with an even more challenging obstacle course.\nJust as familiar content brings a sense of comfort, so does comedy. Many of 2021\u2019s most popular comedy videos centered on relatable, true-to-life events. This video from Canadian creator Jeenie.Weenie, one in a series about her experience as a flight attendant dealing with different types of passengers, has more than 8 million views.\nOther top videos provided a comic twist on the journalistic interview format. Two students interviewed German rapper Shirin David about her lyrics, and U.K. creator Niko Omilana cleverly convinced BBC News to interview him, while also encouraging people to vote. Taking note of the types of content people are engaging with and looking for \u2014 both comfort and comedy \u2014 can help marketers meet consumers where they are with messages that resonate, which is important in times of uncertainty.\nWhereas audiences have embraced long-form videos on familiar themes, short-form video has become a laboratory for new storytelling formats. Hybrid creators who produce YouTube Shorts alongside their long-form videos have illustrated how quick bites can give audiences a novel experience. Chef Nick DiGiovanni\u2019s long-form videos resemble the food content trend that dominated the first 20 years of this century. But his short-form recipes rely on a quirkier, more playful editing style. By creating for both formats, Nick can bake his cake and eat it too.\nSome creators \u2014 like Chingu amiga, a Korean woman living in Mexico \u2014 use short-form videos to highlight cultural nuances. And others share motivational messages and interesting facts. We see this with Indian creator A2 Motivation, whose bite-sized videos and channel have collectively garnered over 6 billion views. By giving us another view of their worlds, Shorts offer an expanded way for creators to connect with audiences.\nFor marketers, sometimes short and sweet works well, whether that\u2019s giving people a look behind the scenes or demonstrating a new way to use your product. Japanese restaurant Horumon Shimata went viral with a warning video showing that dangerously hot car temperatures are capable of cooking raw meat. The brand regularly posts behind-the-scenes food videos that subtly promote the restaurant to diners.\nAs we reflected on 2021, themes of community, comfort, and creativity popped up repeatedly in the videos YouTubers around the world chose to watch. These are not fleeting trends, but broader indicators of the kinds of content consumers need and the creators they love. Marketers who embrace these themes in their video and ad creative will evolve with their viewers and connect with key audiences in the moments that matter."

Here, he shares how to create an agile business that\u2019s ready to tackle today\u2019s challenges and be prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow by focusing your marketing on customer behaviors.\nClosing out this calendar year, businesses are likely realizing that uncertainty is the only certainty. A parade of headlines \u2014 covering labor shortages, supply chain delays, inflation, and uncertain financial markets \u2014 dominate the news and suggest that volatility will persist. As a result, changes in consumer behavior will likely continue, sending a clear signal to brands: Adapt or be left behind.\nAt Reprise Digital, we help ensure that the brands we work with are agile and ready for whatever the future holds. We do this by focusing on how consumers move along the path to purchase, and analyzing and assessing those behaviors holistically, rather than in siloed channels. This approach allows brands to design their marketing around consumer behaviors, which positions them to thrive, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nA great example of this is the work we\u2019ve done with dermocosmetic skin care brand NEOSTRATA and its e-commerce strategy.\nOperating a direct-to-consumer business model, the company sought to efficiently drive traffic and online sales despite having limited awareness. In partnership with Reprise, NEOSTRATA piloted a new approach using Performance Max, which leverages automation to optimize Google and YouTube campaigns in real time. More specifically, this helped the brand hit its predetermined goals by identifying the right ad creative and the right ad placement to reach the customers most likely to convert.\nThe campaign\u2019s results speak for themselves: When comparing three months of Performance Max data to the previous three months of standard Shopping campaigns, NEOSTRATA saw a 91% increase in revenue at a 65% increase in spend, all while increasing efficiency 16%.\nWhile every brand is unique and will see different results, you can follow this example \u2014 and deliver consumer-centric marketing while staying agile \u2014 by employing three key steps. First, enhance your first-party data strategy. Then use automation to optimize your marketing for the right customers. And finally, build a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience.\nAs the economy tightens, many brands are tempted to shift their advertising focus to performance and results. With increased scrutiny on ROI, marketing teams will need to work smarter, using data to achieve greater scale and better outcomes without sacrificing effectiveness. This requires having a sustainable first-party data strategy in place.\nFirst-party data can create new value for your marketing, improve ad performance, and help you deepen relationships with your customers. To build a strong strategy, it\u2019s critical to know exactly what data you need to collect from customers and have a clear plan for how it will be used. For example, NEOSTRATA identified its website visitors, particularly those who did not make a purchase, as a crucial audience to help drive the highest quality leads.\nAs you develop your strategy, keep in mind that value exchange is paramount. You must give your customers something of value in return for their consented data, such as early access to new product launches, personalized recommendations, exclusive products, and other unique offers.\nIn times of volatility, brands should shift their focus away from generalized outcomes, like the number of clicks, toward customers who are the most valuable and profitable. And because customer journeys are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to measure, leveraging automation is increasingly important.\nWith automation, it\u2019s possible to focus your campaign reach on those online customers who are most likely to shop with your brand. Tools like Performance Max, for instance, allow you to promote products across a range of channels, and ensure that you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. This capability becomes even more powerful when you\u2019re able to combine it with first-party data you\u2019ve collected and build lists of people who may be interested in your products.\nAutomation becomes even more significant when you factor in nuances like fluctuating demand across markets, because it can keep pace with shifting consumer behavior faster than a manual, human-led process. In this way, automation can be a particularly vital device for keeping your business agile and ready to react to changes in real time.\nWe certainly saw this with NEOSTRATA. Using Performance Max, the marketing team was able to optimize their Google Shopping feed, regularly rotate ad copy and collateral, and develop a complete set of audience signals, like website visitors and purchases used to target new customers. And all of this was done at scale and across new formats like video, which is crucial for driving conversions across a full-funnel strategy.\nIncreasingly, brands need to think beyond in-store versus online, linear versus digital marketing, or mid-funnel versus lower-funnel conversions and embrace a more connected, omnichannel customer experience. Indeed, a recent survey by McKinsey found that 75% of U.S. consumers say they\u2019re going both online and into stores to research and buy products across categories.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? A fully connected customer experience collapses the traditional marketing funnel and authentically reflects how people are actually shopping today. For example, people increasingly use the internet to discover new products and often end up buying products immediately after researching them. So what has traditionally been an upper-funnel activity is now also a purchasing opportunity through various shoppable media. This means that every connection you make is a chance to acquire a new customer.\nDuring the past couple of years, NEOSTRATA focused on expanding their approach from selling products mainly in dermatology offices to selling directly to consumers. That meant the brand needed to create experiences that make it easier for customers to convert throughout the funnel, whether they were comparing different skin care products through Search or discovering the brand for the first time on YouTube. In fact, combining search and video is especially important, as research shows that YouTube advertisers see brand videos driving 28% of their conversion assists.1\nAmid a volatile economic forecast, it\u2019s more important than ever for your businesses to adapt and stay agile. You can set yourself up for success by developing a smart first-party data strategy, leveraging automation to find the most valuable customers and creating a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience. With these tactics, your business can drive growth now and capitalize on new opportunities in the future."

        "output": "A version of this article first appeared on the YouTube Blog on February 27, 2023.\nEquity and inclusion are at the forefront of YouTube\u2019s mission. Upholding it means that our teams are constantly exploring how our norms, practices, and policies may inadvertently create bias and inequity on the platform.\nThis is why, in 2020, we established a dedicated Racial Justice, Equity, and Product Inclusion team to ensure that the voices of historically underrepresented communities were incorporated early into the development of our products and protocols. Since then, one of the team\u2019s core programs \u2014 called the Inclusion Working Group (IWG) \u2014 has played a critical role in embedding equity into YouTube\u2019s platform and business.\nWe created the IWG as a resource to help our employees consider key risks and opportunities during the development of new products, processes, and policies. It consists of a dedicated product inclusion lead, executive sponsors, employee resource group (ERG) representatives, and leaders from across YouTube \u2014 including experts in machine learning and responsible AI.\nWhile we have a long way to go, the IWG has been a significant step forward in YouTube\u2019s commitment to driving equality. We also acknowledge the power of sharing our progress, with the hope that it can help inspire others to tackle inequality with us, together.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re eager to share three key things that have helped the IWG succeed.\nBeing user first is core to everything we do at YouTube, and it\u2019s imperative that our users see themselves and their lived experiences reflected in our products and policies.\nDelivering on this requires teams to consider equity and inclusion early and often in the development process, so they have time to identify and mitigate risks, and adjust direction when necessary. The IWG makes this possible.\nThe group partners directly with teams to understand how they plan to use machine learning, whether facets of identity are considered in their products, whether new launches may lead to undue hate and harassment, and more.\nAlready, we\u2019ve seen the IWG\u2019s contributions help teams improve a range of projects and programs. For example, it directly influenced the creation of new safety protocols for the first-ever all-female broadcast of a Major League Baseball game last summer. The IWG also helped improve how we detect racially insensitive comments on YouTube, prepared our teams to better identify and respond to new forms of online hate, and provided constant advocacy for the safety and diverse representation of Creators in product launches.\nBy design, the IWG gets its strength from its members \u2014 a consultative, cross-functional team of professionals that span YouTube\u2019s product areas, varied ERGs, and its executive leadership.\nIn addition to its members\u2019 vast expertise and experience, executive sponsorship and buy-in are essential to formalize and champion the IWG\u2019s role. The group helps to mitigate risk and improve the overall quality of product launches by assembling voices from across multiple functions and underrepresented groups to consider questions of inclusion.\nTo date, the IWG has partnered with YouTube teams on over 900 projects. In 2023, the program will expand its coverage to 100% of YouTube\u2019s product teams and range of collaborators. It will also provide guidance on how to prioritize equity across product strategy and to increase visibility among teams. Additionally, the IWG will focus on educating teams by sharing learnings from case studies, research, frameworks, and other content to continue driving scalable ways of thinking equity-first.\nWhile this work will take time and thoughtful discussion, we are motivated by the ways it will benefit the entire YouTube ecosystem for years to come. We acknowledge there is much to do and look forward to sharing more of our progress as we continue this work."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Flying cars may have been a sign of the times on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d but in real life, electric vehicles (EVs) are ushering us into the future. Just as gas-powered engines replaced horse-drawn carts a century ago, EVs are disrupting the industry and setting the standard for the next hundred years of auto innovation.\nIn short, EVs are taking over. EV sales in the U.S. rose 62% in the first half of this year, and now make up 5% of new car sales. While this may sound small, it actually marks a tipping point for EV adoption. The shift to EVs could also accelerate rapidly, as drivers are still feeling squeezed by higher gas prices. In fact, searches for \u201cbest gas mileage\u201d are growing globally by 90% year over year.1 And, according to industry analysts, about 45% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.\nThese numbers have helped automakers see the EV light. They\u2019re investing over $526 billion in an all-electric future, which includes building new assembly lines and parts, learning to produce and store batteries, and preparing for changing tax implications.\nBut is their marketing keeping pace too? As brands work to get EVs in the hands of consumers, many auto marketers are still relying on an outdated playbook. Here are three ways they can rethink stale strategies and make their EV marketing as electric as their vehicles.\nAn avalanche of EVs is coming, leading to a crowded marketplace. The 2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Car Wars report projects that by 2026, 60% of the new models launched will be electric or hybrid.2 And more models mean more choices for auto shoppers.\nIn addition to a crowded market, automakers will also have to contend with the fact that EV models do not have the same level of brand recognition that gas-powered vehicles do. Indeed, 1 in 4 consumer searches for EVs are unbranded.3\nThis means automakers need to build brand recognition for new vehicles now to be well positioned and top of mind when EV options increase for shoppers. One way to achieve this is through video ads that can differentiate a brand\u2019s EV from the competition by touting its unique selling points. In our studies, we found that 80% of new auto purchasers took an action after watching a video,4 such as searching online for more information, visiting a dealer website, scheduling a test drive, or creating custom specifications for a new vehicle online.\nTo see how high consumer interest in EVs is, you only need to look online, where searches for EVs are accelerating. People are also looking for more detailed information about EVs, which suggests they might be heading further into the consideration phase. For example, while searches for \u201celectric vehicle\u201d have grown 87% year over year globally,5 more detailed searches like \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d have also grown by 80%.6 And searches for \u201cbest electric cars 2022\u201d have grown in the U.S. by over 5,000% year over year.7\nThis gives brands the opportunity to meet people in search results and answer their most common questions and concerns. This in turn will help brands become a major part of customers\u2019 path to purchase, guiding them every step of the way. But which search subjects should brands focus on?\nAccording to Gearshift, the most researched topics by people interested in EVs are general explorations of EV or hybrid vehicles, vehicle charging information, maintenance, and environmental benefits.8 And notably, the top two concerns that prevent people from considering EVs are anxieties over vehicle charging or range and other technological issues.9\nPotential EV customers may be at an all-time high for consideration, but they\u2019re very unsure about making the final purchase. Most potential buyers are undecided on whether or not to buy an electric car, and most of them won\u2019t end up converting.10 In the end, just 33% of new U.S. car buyers who considered a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle bought one.11\nApproaching hesitant buyers with outdated marketing tactics and a one-size-fits-all message probably won\u2019t make much of a dent, especially since the EV market is evolving so rapidly. Brands must be able to zig as customers zag and deliver tailored messaging to varying customer segments with different needs and concerns.\nTo do this at scale, brands should use automation and machine learning to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time. The real-time data from automated campaigns can also help brands learn more about potential customers and easily tweak their messaging to increase its effectiveness. By using these modern marketing tools, brands can convince hesitant buyers to choose a vehicle of the future.\nAs consideration and sales of EVs rapidly increase, automakers can set themselves up for success by using video to differentiate their brand and EV models from the competition, appearing in EV search results to answer customer questions, and leveraging automation to deliver the right message to a wide range of consumers.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Whether it\u2019s pressing the reset button or discovering new cultures, travel can be a restorative and inspiring experience. But for many LGBTQ+ travelers, it comes with underlying stresses.\nBoth during the planning stage and on the trip itself, they can feel forced to hide their authentic selves. Traditional booking touchpoints, such as the research phase or checking in at the chosen accommodation \u2014 which should be part of the fun \u2014 become a source of anxiety.\nAmon Versteeg, senior director of business marketing at Booking.com, knows from personal experience what this is like. So he worked closely with his team to introduce the Travel Proud program, which helps to make travel a safer, more enjoyable experience for the LGBTQ+ community.\nWith hospitality defined as \u201cthe friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers,\u201d feeling welcome is an intrinsic part of the customer experience. And when it comes to creating inclusive hospitality, Booking.com\u2019s motto is \u201cyou can\u2019t truly experience the world if you only show up as half of yourself.\u201d\nThis underscores what prompted the birth of Travel Proud \u2014 \u200b\u200ba training and certification initiative for the hospitality industry to ensure the LGBTQ+ community can travel safely and experience the full joy of travel, no matter who they love or how they identify.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ community is not accustomed to being 100% themselves. Over time and over history, we\u2019ve learned to suppress a part of who we are,\u201d Versteeg explains.\nThis means that LGBTQ+ people tend to travel with what Versteeg describes as a \u201cdetective mindset,\u201d constantly searching for clues as to whether they will truly be welcome at their chosen destination, even if it is advertised as inclusive tourism.\nVersteeg\u2019s aha! moment came when he was planning a safari with friends, and they found an incredible ecotourism site. He checked an LGBTQ+ inclusive lodging directory, found the lodge there, and excitedly told his friends.\n\u201cMy friend didn\u2019t understand why this was important, so I explained I didn\u2019t want to get to the middle of the safari and find out there would be an issue with my husband and I. My friend then said we\u2019d just have to tell them we were brothers if that happened.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s not innate to everyone to think about this. It still grounds me.\u201d\nTo better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ travelers, Booking.com conducted a survey to gauge the community\u2019s lived experiences. It revealed that more than half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had a less than welcoming travel experience.\nThis includes situations that are not necessarily intentional but can make people feel unwelcome or stressed while on vacation. For example, 20% of those surveyed had staff assume they would need separate rooms or beds when checking in as a couple, while 1 in 5 have felt the need to change their behavior \u2014 and 16% to change their appearance \u2014 to avoid judgment or awkward interactions with accommodation staff or owners.\nVersteeg\u2019s team also identified keywords and feelings from each travel touchpoint, such as researching where to stay, the actual process of booking (for example, does the property booking page use gendered or binary terms only), the arrival at the property, and their experience during their stay.\nThe results were striking. \u201cA word that repeatedly came up throughout the journey, from research through to check-in at accommodation, was \u2018caution.\u2019 And it soon became clear that \u2018safe\u2019 means \u2018good.\u2019 And at the end of the journey the emotion is \u2018relief,\u2019\u201d says Versteeg.\n\u201cFor example, when someone in our trans community is checking into accommodation, and they provide identification with a gender different to how they\u2019re presenting: This is a huge moment,\u201d Versteeg explains. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for companies to really show what welcoming looks like. Whether it\u2019s avoiding gendered pronouns or knowing that it\u2019s OK to ask what your guest prefers. That can have a huge impact.\u201d\nTravel Proud seeks to address this issue. Property owners who host on Booking.com receive coaching from Hospitable Me, which specializes in diversity and inclusion training for the hospitality industry. This training guides property owners on how they can make their venue more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ travelers, and provides tools to grow awareness and understanding. In turn, they will be featured as an inclusive destination on the Booking.com site.\nAs well as the number of venues that signed up to the program (10,000 and counting), Versteeg notes that he was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of properties that are now listed through Travel Proud, from small one-off rural destinations to major venues. \u201cIn a short time, we already surpassed 10,000 properties achieving the Proud Certified standard in our key focus markets.\u201d\nTravel Proud is a big part of Booking.com\u2019s work to deliver more authentic experiences to travelers. For LGBTQ+ travelers specifically, Versteeg states the need to challenge the meaning of what good travel means. \u201cUltimately, a good experience should be more than a safe experience. When we hold a mirror up, we ask \u2018Have we done this for everyone?\u2019\u201d\nFor other companies wishing to make similar strides, Versteeg advises starting small: \u201cFocus on understanding what would make a difference in your organization, and then turn it into many small steps. See it as a continuous journey rather than a destination.\u201d"

        "output": "Marketers are under strain as the economy and privacy regulations continue to shift at a rapid pace. Eighty-nine percent of marketing decision-makers agree that leadership is raising the pressure on them to demonstrate ROI, according to research that Google recently commissioned with Kantar.1\nAs a result, finding effective ways to assess how well your advertising works, while remaining privacy-conscious, is more important than ever. In this environment, how can you be confident when making decisions that set up your business for growth?\nAI-powered solutions can strengthen confidence and deliver better outcomes, all in a privacy-safe way. But to get the most from these solutions, you need to lay the groundwork and get the essentials right. By building your first-party data strategy and setting up a privacy-first digital marketing foundation, you can unlock better measurement and effectively collaborate with AI to drive business results.\nTo deliver results today and drive sustainable growth tomorrow, focus on these four key areas.\nPrivacy and performance aren\u2019t at odds. AI-powered solutions enable you to balance the two and unlock advantages for your business. This is because the predictive and analytical capabilities of AI deliver improved ROI while filling the measurement gaps created with the phaseout of third-party cookies.\nThe first step is to implement a first-party data strategy. This requires thoughtfully communicating with your customers when gathering consent about how you do and don\u2019t use their data. Research suggests that a proactive approach to privacy can give marketers a significant leg up with consumers.\nIn a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 49% of respondents said a positive privacy experience with a second-choice brand would convince them to choose that brand over a preferred brand.2\nOnce you\u2019ve built a durable foundation of first-party data, you can unlock more accurate measurement and gain a clearer view of the customer journey. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.\nThe marketing team at Calendly, a scheduling automation company, understands that a privacy-first marketing strategy is only as strong as the technologies that support it. So they built a privacy-safe measurement infrastructure that allowed them to focus on their most profitable customers.\nThrough sitewide tagging, Calendly defined the type of user that would sign up for an account and push for larger team adoption. Next, it joined the brand\u2019s online and offline data to better understand the customer journey. Within 10 months, Calendly had a full-funnel view of its highest-value prospects and customers. Furthermore, this site-tagging implementation helped the marketing team convince leadership to invest in long-term data and measurement infrastructure. As Jessica Gilmartin, CMO of Calendly, shares, \u201cby connecting Google AI to our product and customer data, we\u2019ve been able to prove the ROI of our marketing investments to our executive team. It\u2019s completely changed the game for us.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve made gains in first-party data collection, AI-powered solutions like modeling, predictive targeting, and analytics can inform your measurement strategy \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have user-level data. This fusion of innovation and privacy will help you take your business to the next level while being responsible stewards of people\u2019s data.\nPrivacy-first data collection is only the first step. A natural follow-on opportunity is to use AI-powered insights to better understand what\u2019s working well. For example, the Insights page in Google Ads uses AI to help you predict rising search trends, understand performance changes, and uncover new audiences that may not conform to your typical customer profile. Insights like these give you an alternate view of your customers\u2019 characteristics and behaviors \u2014 including ad engagements \u2014 so you can connect with them in more meaningful ways.\nSearch agency Solutions 8 used Google AI to uncover surprising insights on behalf of a food industry client. Solutions 8 ran a Performance Max campaign for its client, a producer of shelf-stable food products marketed to a particular type of customer, namely \u201cdoomsday preppers.\u201d Thanks to the Insights page in Google Ads, the agency soon learned that audiences with an interest in boating and sailing significantly outperformed the client\u2019s traditional audience. With that knowledge, it created assets for this previously unrealized customer segment and started a new campaign for the sailing audience.\nBy combining first-party data with insights, marketers can take decisive actions that lead to improved ROI and business outcomes.\nGoogle AI can help you achieve more precise campaign performance by predicting future consumer behavior and constantly optimizing to your KPIs.\nFor example, German online retailer Baur turned to Google Analytics 4 predictive audiences for a recent Google Ads campaign. By targeting an audience of likely purchasers, it achieved sales growth of 56% and an increase in conversion rate of 87%. In fact, Baur calculated that 70% of these customers could only be reached using these predictive audiences in Google Ads.\nYou can also use audience and performance data to inform AI-based solutions that maximize results over time. Take Smart Bidding, which uses Google AI to optimize your bids in every auction and increase conversions based on your goals. Using Smart Bidding, the French automobile brand Citro\u00ebn saw a 16% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) by implementing a value-based bid strategy.\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. We encourage you to adopt an iterative mindset so you can operate as confidently as possible. A spirit of experimentation will validate that your measurement and our AI powered solutions are working in a world with fewer individual identifiers.\nFor instance, advertisers who use marketing mix models (MMM) should use experiments to calibrate those models. A single experiment may be sufficient to effectively modify your MMM. When Google commissioned Nielsen to use NCSolutions\u2019 sales-lift results to calibrate its mix models, the revenue and ROAS attributed to YouTube increased 84% on average.\nThe majority of that volume was previously attributed to base variables (brand distribution and pricing), thus reallocating that volume to YouTube improved marketing results overall.\nBy directly validating what\u2019s working, you\u2019ll be able to combine your own learnings with Google AI to enable more accurate measurement and deliver results for your business.\nWe\u2019re at a critical moment in our industry. Our goal at Google is to give you confidence that your first-party data foundation, audience modeling, and measurement setup are all working hard to deliver results for you. With AI-powered tools at your fingertips, you can rest assured that you\u2019re building the most effective and cost-efficient measurement strategies possible while respecting the privacy of your customers."

Hayes is also a GLAAD board member and serves as global executive sponsor of Google\u2019s LGBTQ employee resource group.\nIn recent years, companies have increasingly recognized the value that diverse, inclusive, and equitable marketing practices bring to their brands.

A report published last December by GLAAD \u2014 the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer media advocacy organization \u2014 and the Edelman Trust Institute found that Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding LGBTQ rights.\nAlong with this momentum, however, there have been plenty of setbacks. Marketers in the U.S. are likely familiar, for instance, with recent backlash experienced by one major retailer for displaying Pride Month merchandise, and the scrutiny experienced by a major brewing and beverage company after partnering with a transgender influencer. These mixed signals \u2014 rising consumer support on the one hand, push back on the other \u2014 can leave brands unsure of their own inclusive marketing plans.\nSo what does the data actually say about people\u2019s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and what should brands be doing \u2014 with confidence \u2014 to honor their inclusive marketing commitments?\nGLAAD recently released two studies that can be instructive. Its ninth annual Accelerating Acceptance study, which examines acceptance and attitudes toward LGBTQ Americans, showed that a record number of non-LGBTQ Americans support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. Support is quite literally at an all-time high. But an analysis of representation in advertising tells a different story.\nThis month, GLAAD\u2019s Advertising Visibility Index \u2014 an inaugural research report offering a data-backed reality check on LGBTQ representation in U.S. advertising, along with prescriptive guidance for brands \u2014 indicated that the LGBTQ community\u2019s size is not accurately reflected in ads and that current methods of inclusion are not always apparent to consumers. The takeaway is that there is room for improvement for the vast majority of brands.\nRecently, I sat down with Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO at GLAAD, to discuss the two studies and identify actions that marketers can take today to make their marketing more inclusive.\nSarah Kate Ellis: Our findings are really significant for marketers. For instance, we found that 3 out of 4 non-LGBTQ adults feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, which seems to validate that the backlash to inclusive ad campaigns really is coming from a small, though loud, number of activists. Inclusion is not only good for the bottom line, but when consumers are exposed to LGBTQ people and their lives in the media, that exposure has a profound impact on shifting culture and changing sentiments. Sixty percent of non-LGBTQ adults agree that seeing LGBTQ people in ads make them more comfortable with people who are different than themselves.1 So inclusion actually creates a more accepting society.\nEllis: Yes. We\u2019ve seen influencers and celebrities increasingly used in brand advertising, in general, and over 70% of inclusive ads we studied featured LGBTQ celebrities.2 But here\u2019s what is interesting: When it comes to LGBTQ representation, inclusion of an LGBTQ celebrity is the least important factor for consumers, LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ. What they\u2019re actually looking for are displays of empathy and humanity, followed by realistic storylines, like families sharing meals or couples holding hands.3 People want to see the everyday, human stuff. It\u2019s realistic stories over celebrity endorsement.\nEllis: While it\u2019s distressingly loud, it\u2019s actually far from the norm. Only 17% of consumers say seeing LGBTQ representation in brand advertising would make them feel more negatively about a brand. And only 16% of consumers say they would be less likely to purchase that brand\u2019s products or services.4 At a time when 1 in 5 Gen Zers in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, the calls for inclusion will continue to grow and be louder than the critics.\nSo negativity exists, but it\u2019s a really small portion of people who feel that way. Inclusive marketing is everywhere, and just because a few brands get called out by a loud minority, does not mean that inclusive marketing will end. While the headlines focused on a few brands that tried to appease critics by changing Pride campaigns, so many other brands stood their ground and that supposed backlash faded.\nEllis: Absolutely. We posed all of these questions about LGBTQ representation, and while we know it\u2019s become both more common in some circles, it\u2019s become more contentious. But what was unexpected was that a lot of people aren\u2019t even noticing LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly two-thirds of consumers believe LGBTQ representation is explicit enough to be noticed by most people, but less than 40% of consumers noticed the representation in LGBTQ inclusive Super Bowl ads.5 So even when it\u2019s happening, people aren\u2019t always aware of it.\nEllis: Well, for starters, this is bigger than marketing. Seventy percent of non-LGBTQ consumers want companies to show public support not just in advertising but in sponsorships and hiring as well.6\nBeyond that, I think the biggest takeaway for me is the idea that representation means more than existence, more than the old \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d model. Today, it\u2019s more about being an integral part of your community. We\u2019re your neighbors and your co-workers; we\u2019re in your congregation and in your family. We\u2019re part of the fabric of society, and marketers must show that. LGBTQ people have the same desires and needs as every other American. We buy cars and laundry detergent, and we worry about our kids and our bills just like everyone else. That\u2019s the story folks in the LGBTQ community want told, and it\u2019s the story that needs to be told.\nAt Google, we\u2019re always striving to increase representation, especially during big moments, but it\u2019s imperative this remains a focus year-round. These findings are a great reminder that our work is never done and that our approach to inclusive marketing can still be improved if we want to stay relevant now and in the future. For example, my team worked on Google Pixel\u2019s Super Bowl ad this year, which featured queer artist Doja Cat. GLAAD tested this ad as part of the Advertising Index, and a majority of consumers who viewed it didn\u2019t recognize any LGBTQ inclusion. It\u2019s on us, and fellow advertisers, to seize the opportunity to tell more realistic, human LGBTQ stories."

        "input": "",
        "output": "We\u2019re in the middle of a third paradigm shift. The first shift was the arrival of the internet, with its revolution in information and services. The second was the explosion of mobile computing, driven by the adoption of smartphones. And today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to deliver transformations that are even more profound, for both consumers and businesses.\nKristen O\u2019Hara, VP of brand and agency solutions at Google, addresses a crowd of conference goers about the AI paradigm shift.\nAs with the internet and smartphones, the emergence of AI is a critical development for businesses. But how best to strategize? Naturally, it\u2019s important that we exercise caution in the face of uncertainty to mitigate potential risk. As with any powerful new tech, we must actively work to understand AI and its implications for our customers and marketing activities. Remember, we\u2019re not competing against AI, we\u2019re competing against businesses that are already using AI.\nThe good news: Chances are, you\u2019re already using AI. Here at Google, we\u2019ve been layering it into our products for years. From autocomplete in Search to captioning on YouTube to Translate\u2019s mastery of over 100 languages, our products have gotten steadily better as a direct result of this technology.\nEighty percent of marketers are already using at least one AI-powered Search ads product as a business multiplier right now.1 And tests have shown that advertisers who upgrade their exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns using a target cost per acquisition can see an average of 35% more conversions.2\nPerformance Max offers another useful example. With this product, advertisers bring their business objectives, first-party data, and some creative assets. Google AI will then optimize marketing campaigns across Search, YouTube, Discovery, Maps, and more, meeting customers wherever they are. Advertisers using Performance Max are seeing an 18% uplift in conversions, up 5% since last year, showing just how quickly Google\u2019s AI models are advancing.3\nPerformance Max is about to get even more powerful. We recently announced we\u2019re incorporating generative AI to make it even easier for advertisers to create custom assets and scale them in a few clicks. Just provide your website, and Google AI will learn about your brand, populating your campaign with text and other relevant assets. We\u2019ll even suggest new images generated just for you, helping you stand out to customers across a wide range of inventory and formats.\nWith the power of AI, we\u2019ll discover endless possibilities for creativity through direct collaboration and experimentation. Today, AI can help you write a form letter or optimize your media mix. Tomorrow, it may overhaul your creative workflows, freeing you up to solve entirely new creative and strategic challenges.\nFor example, AI is helping The New York Times organize 7 million photos from over 100 years of reporting. Working with Google Cloud, the Times has digitized its vast photo collection, which had been stored in hundreds of filing cabinets three stories below street level in a space called the \u201cmorgue.\u201d But digitally storing the pictures is only part of the story. To make the archive accessible and useful, the Times used AI to \u201cread\u201d the images, not only by scanning text in the images and notes written on the back but by recognizing objects and places in the photographs, preserving annotations, and making the archive searchable. Now Times journalists can use this resource to report stories rooted in deep historical context.\nGenerative AI is opening up even more possibilities, and we are rapidly moving to a world where the constraints on what you can create in digital spaces are limited only by your imagination.\nWhat will this mean for all of us as marketers? For one, the gap between coming up with a great idea and deploying that idea will shrink considerably. For example, the new Product Studio tool uses generative AI to help businesses of all sizes create a range of high-quality product imagery. Product Studio can create custom product scenes for seasonal or trending opportunities, remove distracting backgrounds, or even increase the resolution and sharpness of your product photos without having to go through expensive reshoots.\nThese are powerful technologies with consequences for individuals and organizations that are still not well understood. As we move boldly toward this future of creative possibility, we must take a responsible approach. We can\u2019t see around every corner, but we can anchor to principles, respond to challenges that arise, and partner with researchers, governments, and communities to ensure we get it right.\nI\u2019ve been asking myself and my team some tough questions as we navigate this third paradigm shift. Here are a few questions you can ask as your teams figure out how to harness the power of AI."

        "input": "",
        "output": "For years, marketers have been integrating AI-powered products into nearly every aspect of their work, gaining critical insights and driving more conversions with improved campaign optimizations.\nMore recently, the profusion of news surrounding generative AI has renewed the critical importance of the human in the driver\u2019s seat, especially when it comes to building advertising creative. Commercial creative would not exist without the talent behind it, full stop. And just as marketers have been using AI-powered tools, creatives have been experimenting with AI in everything from ads that talk back to concept decks that sing.\nWith responsive search ads (RSA) and responsive display ads (RDA), we\u2019ve already seen the ability of AI to optimize thoughtfully crafted assets into the best-performing combinations of creative. We know that AI can scale asset production to serve the most relevant version of an ad across channels via Performance Max, App, and Video action campaigns. Now, to get a pulse on how interdisciplinary creative teams are already exploring AI, we asked agency leads across three regions how they use it. Here\u2019s what they said.\nDuring the 2019 holiday season, a team tasked with selling the Google Nest to Australian shoppers had a unique opportunity to let people test the product from the comfort of their own homes.\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the experience of Nest into the ad itself, so that was the moonshot then \u2014 essentially, quite a while back before generative AI was a thing,\u201d said Tingyan Han, senior data strategy director, APAC at EssenceMediacom. \u201cWe needed to demonstrate the many ways in which Nest makes moments at home better.\u201d\nTo do that, the team turned to a speech-to-text API co-authored by Google with the help of the Google Nest and Google Media Lab teams.\n\u201cThere were many considerations when working with a speech-to-text API, from the UX to ad inventory and measurement, all the way down to testing whether local accents were recognizable,\u201d said Han. The ad would pause within the first few frames to allow the user time to opt in to the experience. When users said, \u201cHey Google, show me gingerbread house recipes,\u201d it would do as told.\nThe activation led to an increase in consideration to purchase. Vincent Tay, creative director, APAC at EssenceMediacom, says that\u2019s because the interactivity served to demonstrate the benefits of the product itself.\n\u201cWhile the thought of integrating new and shiny technology into every facet of our campaign can be alluring, we must always remember to place the human truth at its core,\u201d said Tay, who partnered with a UX/UR designer alongside Han on the campaign.\nMore recently, Publicis-owned Leo Burnett Australia used AI to build a talking car; Leo Burnett Taiwan used another kind of AI to celebrate Lunar New Year with potato chip-inspired fortunes.\n\u201cWe have been using Google Colab regularly for early prototyping efforts involving up-and-coming AI algorithms,\u201d said Laurent Thevenet, head of creative tech at Publicis covering APAC and MEA. \u201cWe are also starting to use Bard, as we like the fact that it is connected to the internet and can retrieve real-time information.\u201d\nIn addition to sending regular updates on emerging tech to its 4,000 creatives across the region, Publicis is also mentoring talent internally, sending mentees back to their respective agencies and teams with new knowledge.\n\u201cMachines need operators and, for the creative industry, it means that creatives will partner with machines, directing them towards the desired output,\u201d said Thevenet. \u201cThese creatives have to be hybrid talents able to think critically while having the ability to operate and connect these emerging AI systems with one another.\u201d\n\u201cImagine a concept store on the moon. What does that look like?\u201d\nEd Yeoman, creative director at London-based branding and design agency Human After All, has observed his team bringing AI into the ideation stage to collaborate on design fiction for this type of \u201cwild-card idea.\u201d\n\u201cSome people use it to get verbal prompts around language and messaging, and some people use it to get visual prompts to help them kind of imagine something that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d including events and event spaces, he said.\nGabriel Cheung, Global Executive Creative Director, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, says AI-generated content can also challenge teams to push their thinking. \u201cBecause of the way AI works with existing information, we let AI-powered tools quickly generate the \u2018first thought\u2019 ideas. Our thinking is that if AI can generate the same idea, then we haven\u2019t done our job well enough to come up with something new,\u201d said Cheung.\nGoogle recently announced a new conversational experience in Google Ads and Search campaigns that can be used to enhance brainstorms, a use case Yeoman\u2019s team found helpful.\n\u201c[The prompting] part of the process \u2026 puts you in the role of the creative or strategic director,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cOftentimes, at that level, you\u2019re helping to frame challenges for people to inspire them to do certain things. It\u2019s the same with AI. You\u2019re hoping to frame this challenge in a way which gives you an optimal output.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s announcement of the forthcoming addition of Adobe Firefly to Bard represents a commitment to ethical image generation. Firefly is trained on a catalog of hundreds of millions of licensed images in Adobe Stock. As private technology companies develop responsible AI and call for regulation, creative agencies are writing their own ethical guidelines.\n\u201cWe felt that there was a little bit of a lack of people talking about what it meant for humans,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cAt the heart of our business are the principles of empathy and reason. We try and build those into everything.\u201d\nEvery year, global creative agency Jellyfish Group invites its own technologists to a companywide hackathon. The participants invited to this year\u2019s event in Paris received a new kind of challenge: design an AI-powered solution for improving the quality and performance of creative assets. The event brought 120 technologists across data, media, and creative together to address this critical business need.\n\u201cThe benefit is huge; it elevates everyone\u2019s knowledge and experience, and that carries throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Sam Yates, chief solutions officer of creative technology at Jellyfish.\n\u201cAI has developed so fast and there\u2019s so much opportunity, but it\u2019s also kind of a wild West scenario,\u201d said Di Wu, VP of data science at Jellyfish Group. \u201cPeople are just starting to think about regulation and what it means for us to adopt AI. We created a task force around it to basically say, AI is not just about ethics; it\u2019s literally a business problem for us. If we\u2019re not using AI the right way, it could lead to bias because of the training samples used [to train the hypothetical model].\u201d Agencies will soon have access to more tools to create variations on their own work, ensuring ownability.\nWorking within established partner networks is one way to ensure safety, added Yates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stifle innovation in any way, but we do have to think about some of the risk mitigations that go with exploring new technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking closely with Google, for example, is a great opportunity for us to explore a tech stack in a safe and responsible way.\u201d\nEven before the milestones of 2023, Google had partnered with Jellyfish to design a bespoke service powered by Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Vision and Video APIs. \u201cOptics\u201d could decode which elements of an ad performed best according to a brand\u2019s goals and best practices like the YouTube ABCDs. With advances in AI, such methodologies could eventually enable teams to distinguish emotional content across ads, or even the presence of humor, to shed light on which creative choices resonated most with their brands\u2019 audiences.\nOnce teams have finalized creative assets, they can get the most out of them using smart creative formats like RSAs and RDAs. Tools like Performance Max can help make sure the right ad reaches the right audience at the right time, optimized for their chosen channels and screens. Research shows that advertisers see 2X more conversions, on average, when adding an RDA to an ad group with a static display ad.\nFrom creative testing to storyboarding, AI-powered solutions have a pivotal role to play in the future of creative development. The role itself must be defined by the needs of real creative teams, and some of the most useful applications may be found unexpectedly. Through active exploration and experimentation with AI, we can discover more concrete ways of thinking about the guardrails we want to uphold and the benefits to creative professionals they unlock."

Here is some key points.\n- Next-generation leaders embrace uncertainty and are able to change course at a moment's notice.\n- These leaders cultivate open-minded, collaborative approaches that spark innovation.\n- They proactively operate outside their comfort zones and think cross-functionally.\n- Collaboration among leadership teams and board of directors is critical for successful digital transformation.\n- Building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors is essential for future-proofing organizations.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In the final entry of our three-part series on digital transformation, Google\u2019s Courtney Rose shares how next-generation leaders deal with uncertainty. Part one focused on how organizational shifts help companies transform, and part two explored the role of a strong relationship between CMO and CFO.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent times, the only certainty companies have is uncertainty. This can be challenging for organizations who strive to be digital first, as rapid industry shifts can easily pull their focus away from continuous innovation.\nBut some companies have figured out digital success. When we recently teamed up with Kantar to study how these companies navigated dynamic markets while preparing for the future, we saw a common trait: All had leaders who could boldly face the unknown and confidently change course at a moment\u2019s notice. These leaders transformed the fabric of their organizations, cultivating open-minded, collaborative approaches that sparked innovation, and did it in the face of constant change.\nOur research underscored that this type of next-generation leadership is defined by three behaviors that other companies can implement. The first is proactively operating outside traditional comfort zones. The second involves thinking cross-functionally, and the third focuses on elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\nDuring our research, many next-generation leaders said that building a digitally savvy organization requires CxOs to work outside their comfort zones by thinking broadly about their role and the role of the C-suite, and by responding to change through teamwork and creative problem solving. Our study showed that 70% of executives from digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset, compared to 47% from digitally emerging companies.1\nThis collaborative mindset is key to leading effectively during uncertainty.2 Among the marketing executives we spoke to, 80% of those from digitally leading companies agreed that their organization\u2019s most senior marketer is open to change, compared to 64% of those from digitally emerging companies.3 And leaders who combine traditional and nontechnical skills, like adaptability and intellectual curiosity, are in a better position to develop a culture of collaboration and respond effectively to constant change, particularly when it comes to marketing initiatives.\nAs one CTO said, \u201cChange drives people nuts, but people who embrace it are the ones who can actually help us in the future.\u201d4\nAnother way next-generation leaders help their companies stay flexible during uncertain times is by developing a holistic understanding of their entire organization and encouraging cross-functional teamwork. Executives who told us that their marketing leaders proactively monitored company initiatives happening in areas outside of marketing were also 32% more likely to say their company performed much better than their competitors in revenue growth.5 When leaders think cross-functionally, they create the opportunity for marketing, finance, sales, and IT teams to understand how each group\u2019s operations impact the collective and how they can work together to drive growth and innovation.\nWe also learned that this cross-functional collaboration should extend to the leadership teams themselves. Among digitally leading companies, 70% of the CxOs we surveyed stated that support across the C-suite and the board of directors was critical to successful digital transformation. Just 46% of executives from digitally emerging companies acknowledged this level of leadership support.6\nWhen senior leaders are aligned, they can offer their separate teams a clear, unified strategic vision and shared objectives, which can serve as a North Star during volatile moments. They can also encourage greater cross-functional collaboration by removing hierarchy and helping employees further develop soft skills like communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.\nBeyond ensuring C-suite alignment and collaboration, company leaders can future-proof their organizations by building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors.\nThis starts by ensuring that the board consists of the right people. For example, 82% of marketers from digitally leading companies said their board consists of people who can play a contributing role in supporting digital transformation, while only 42% of marketers from digitally emerging companies made the same claim.7 On top of this, board members who are still active in their professions can provide valuable external perspectives, such as spotting pitfalls, challenging assumptions, and bringing fresh ideas to the table.\nNext, leadership must consider the board\u2019s role in the wider organization. CxOs should encourage the board to move away from simple business signoffs and toward engaging with the company\u2019s overarching strategy. In our study, 1 in 3 senior-level marketers said that the board should push leadership to think creatively and take meaningful risks.8 This can help ensure that the company remains focused on digital innovation during disruptive times.\nWhile business leaders can\u2019t control rapid changes in the market, they very much define how their organizations respond and whether they continue to innovate. Next-generation leaders have proven their resilience and flexibility by stepping out of their comfort zones, fostering companywide collaboration, and empowering boards of directors to take an active, valuable role in their companies\u2019 overarching operations and strategies.\nLearn more about how the next generation of leaders drive growth on the route to digital readiness."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret the media landscape has changed. This past year alone we\u2019ve seen a rise in short-form video and a breakout in AI-powered solutions. People are exposed to a wider variety of content and new ways to consume it, and one-size-fits-all campaigns are no longer enough.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners are blazing new trails by ditching the \u201cmatching luggage\u201d approach and accounting for people\u2019s unique needs. From tapping into YouTube trends to designing bespoke creative across formats, these advertisers expertly created unforgettable YouTube campaigns that resonated with audiences and drove results. Here are four lessons gleaned from the winners.\nLife insurance company MassMutual wanted to drive awareness around a bold topic: money. The brand recognized that conversations about finances are important but aren\u2019t always easy to have. It needed a creative way to grab attention and inspire people to tune into the topic. So it created a lighthearted campaign featuring diverse families having conversations about their financial futures amid unexpected events. The result was an intimate, fly-on-the-wall experience.\nMassMutual sought to make its ads unskippable by breaking the fourth wall, ingeniously utilizing the first six seconds to deliver different variations of the statement, \u201cThis is going to be extremely uncomfortable; you might want to skip this.\u201d This small-but-clever detail showed viewers that MassMutual was directly addressing them, creating a powerful connection.\nThe innovative strategy was wildly successful. In a head-to-head test, its 100% watch rate was 14 percentage points higher and costs per view (CPV) were 2X more cost efficient for creative featuring the made-for-YouTube 6-second add-on.\nSource: MassMutual Internal Data.\nLiv Lewis, EVP of EGAMI Group, praised MassMutual for their authenticity. \u201cNot only did they brilliantly embrace diversity of casting, they embraced diversity as it truly shows up in life.\u201d\nPopular blender brand BlendJet needed a campaign that could drive awareness with new customers and transform existing ones into enthusiastic brand advocates. Its strategy? Create compelling content and engage both audiences. BlendJet tapped into big YouTube trends that have stood the test of time. Assets included YouTube fan favorites such as cake or fakes, bewildering viewers with a blender disguised as a cake, and ASMR videos, soothing them with 10 hours of BlendJet assembly.\nBlendJet also mixed things up to appeal to the next generation of YouTube viewers, using the latest video trend: short form. The brand expertly integrated horizontal and vertical assets with long-form and short-form content to connect with audiences across various viewing preferences.\nReturn on advertising spend and scale allowed BlendJet to increase spend by 55% and helped drive a remarkable 66% revenue growth.\nAs Jonathan Daly, head of communications strategy at Droga5 raved, \u201cThis creative naturally utilizes the super power of YouTube as a social platform. It\u2019s designed to be highly addressable to the audience.\u201d\nOn a mission to rev up consideration, eBay Motors sought a platform that would inspire and excite audiences. That\u2019s why it raced toward YouTube, a go-to destination for inspiration. The brand teamed up with Google\u2019s Creative Works to identify trends and insights, landing on one key insight: People come to YouTube to go deep with the creators and content they love. With that in mind, eBay handed YouTube creators the keys and cocreated a masterfully produced five-part series that pitted modded cars against stock cars, with parts all purchased on eBay. Popular YouTube creator and race-car driver Collete Davis hosted each eight to 12 minute episode, featuring a special guest builder representing a subculture and product category.\nTo maximize viewership, eBay paired episode drops with paid YouTube advertising, and the results were remarkable. The brand grew its YouTube channel subscriber count from 700 to over 37,000 subscribers \u2014 606% above its goal \u2014 while generating more than 9 million views across episodes.\nSource: eBay Internal Data.\nDenise Truelove, global VP of brands at Mars Petcare, sang the team\u2019s praises. \u201cThis is a perfect example of a brand becoming entertainment.\u201d\nBeauty brand Dove also leaned into the power of long-form video to foster engagement. Over the years, Dove has fearlessly taken on the subject of real beauty to address timely issues. Recognizing how important parents\u2019 voices are in shaping children\u2019s self-esteem, the brand created nearly four-minute videos as part of its recent Dove Self-Esteem Project campaign. The videos featured face-mapping technology that put toxic advice into mothers\u2019 mouths, leaving viewers captivated.\nFor the initial push, Dove used YouTube Mastheads and in-feed video ads with a powerful thumbnail image to get people to click and watch the video. Additionally, it used video ad sequencing to prime viewers with a 15-second clip before serving the long-form version. The results spoke for themselves: 6.2 million lifted users associated Dove with raising awareness about the toxic advice girls are exposed to.\nAs Lex Beltrone, group creative director of FCB New York, put it, \u201cThis type of long-form video wouldn\u2019t feel right on any other platform but YouTube.\u201d\nBenjamin Moore, a premium paint manufacturer sold at local retailers around the world, faced a challenge. As businesses reopened and people ventured beyond their homes, home improvement took a back seat. Coupled with the economic headwinds, it was more important than ever for the company to support its local retailers. The brand took an innovative approach.

        "output": "AI is transforming marketing in profound and exciting ways. In my conversations with marketers, it\u2019s inspiring to hear how they\u2019re using AI to drive new customer connections, build high-quality creative, and make confident decisions grounded in predictive data.\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that AI can\u2019t drive marketing success by itself. AI is capable of multiplying business results and growth, but only when it\u2019s paired with human expertise. Marketers will continue to be essential in setting clear objectives \u2014 aligned to broader business goals \u2014 so that marketing impact can be accurately measured and decisions about where to invest can be more informed.\nWith that being said, the speed at which technology is evolving can leave even the most innovative marketers wondering whether their current strategies are enough to unlock AI\u2019s full potential and accelerate business growth. That\u2019s where we can help.\nFor several years at Google, we\u2019ve been building products that apply cutting-edge AI to help marketers navigate the rapidly changing landscape. In that time, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with thousands of brands and agencies to accelerate their business growth with AI, and through that experience we\u2019ve learned what works.\nHere are three key areas to prioritize for success with AI.\nA critical, often neglected aspect of AI is the causal relationship between the inputs you give to AI and the business outcomes it can generate. The fact is, AI learns from the data and experience that people provide. The higher quality the inputs, the better the results.\nMarketers who strengthen their measurement strategy and improve the quality of their audience and conversion data, for instance, can guide Google AI to better maximize their ROI. This is particularly true when consented first-party data is an input. Because it comes from direct customer relationships, the data is more durable and uniquely relevant to your business.\nRetailer H&M is a powerful example of how first-party data can be used to improve campaign performance. Last year, H&M\u2019s global head of paid media, Kristoffer Ullenius, and its global digital media analyst, Katarina Ahlner, shared more about their strategy. \u201cWhere we previously didn\u2019t optimize our paid Search campaigns towards acquiring new customers, we now started actively thinking about ways to reach them.\u201d This meant refocusing the strategy to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t buy unless they were influenced by marketing.\nH&M began by deepening its understanding of the value of each customer segment, using a customer life-cycle model rooted in first-party data. This helped the team identify frequent buyers and put less emphasis on reaching them with paid Search, to focus instead on acquiring incremental new customers. Only when customers became less active would they use Search ads to reengage shoppers.\nThis approach, coupled with a shift to a customer-focused Target ROAS bidding strategy, helped H&M grow online revenue from paid Search by more than 70% year over year. According to Ullenius and Ahlner, \u201cAs the whole business moves towards being more customer-centric, it\u2019s been rewarding to see how much impact we can make by focusing our paid efforts on value.\u201d\nWith high-quality data in place, the next key focus area is using AI-powered campaigns to optimize your performance in real time. Every day, we\u2019re seeing that marketers who leverage Google AI can deliver more conversions and get more value out of their campaigns.\nPerformance Max, for example, is a goal-based campaign type that helps advertisers find untapped and incremental opportunities. Advertisers share their campaign goals and creative assets, and our technology automatically produces and runs a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google\u2019s channels.\nSamsung recently put Performance Max to the test across multiple markets to find untapped consumer demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\nAccording to Sandeep Bajpai, director and head of direct-to-consumer marketing at Samsung India, \u201cThe results were phenomenal. With AI-powered campaigns, we doubled our revenue without affecting our return on advertising spend too much.\u201d\nThe final area to prioritize is as critical as data and technology but wholly reliant on people. To get the most out of AI, you need a shared mindset that\u2019s anchored in experimentation and agility.\nIn a recent report created by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, in association with Google, industry leaders shared guidance on how to maximize AI as a business multiplier. Many of them emphasized the importance of a test, learn, and scale mindset, where your team can fail fast but learn quickly which new approaches can unlock profitable growth.\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, explained, \u201cTo protect profitability, experimentation should happen within a controlled environment. Cross-functional teams will need to nurture a test-and-learn culture where leaders can quickly adjust the plan when results don\u2019t come in as expected, or double down on what works.\u201d\nWhile AI solutions may be perceived as disruptive, they can be approached in a gradual manner. Embracing a culture of experimentation is a critical factor for organizations trying to reap the full benefits of AI.\nFor example, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica spent considerable time thoroughly testing AI-powered campaigns and analyzing the business impact of changes to bidding automation, campaign structure, and feed management. According to global performance marketing director Andrea Orlunghi, \u201cTesting new solutions allowed us to create a shared definition of success that spanned across departments.\u201d And its success was tangible. \u201cIn the past two years, combining a wide range of Google AI solutions contributed to nearly a 50% growth in the global online business of EssilorLuxottica.\u201d\nFostering agility by balancing early plans with an ability to pivot is equally important, especially in the context of planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels.\nFor many companies, however, quickly shifting budgets to the biggest opportunities isn\u2019t easy. This is typically due to traditional silos in media channels that carried over to budgets and organizational structures. Unfortunately, these silos can be kryptonite for AI, limiting its ability to optimize and maximize performance.\nBy evolving your multichannel approach to be nimble enough to respond to consumer demands, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to capture incremental performance opportunities as they emerge. This process can be further bolstered by directly aligning marketing KPIs with business goals and partnering with your executive leadership to accurately quantify marketing\u2019s contribution based on key financial metrics. Research shows the results are worth it: Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.1\nIn sharing these AI essentials, it\u2019s my hope that you feel equipped to act today in ways that strengthen your marketing and accelerate business growth for years to come. If you\u2019re interested in learning how you can use Google AI solutions to supercharge your strategy, review the full checklist below and share it with your team."

        "output": "Kendall Kazor is a member of Google\u2019s People Development School for Googlers team, which produces Resilience at Google, a podcast examining the science behind resilience and high performance. This excerpted interview features a conversation from Season 2.\nCreativity can be hard to define, but it\u2019s an essential skill in today\u2019s workforce. Creativity helps us solve existing challenges and envision new opportunities, and it is considered an X-factor by many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies.\nAs the pace of work and connectivity steadily increases, how do we create the space we need to come up with our best ideas? Can we be creative and productive at the same time? And how do we keep the creative spark lit, even when we start to feel drained? These are questions we hear often from Googlers, but they are not questions unique to Google.\nIn April of this year, we launched a podcast series to help people better understand resilience, which we define as the ability to respond to and recover from stress. Every episode pairs neuroscientists and psychologists with mental performance coaches who discuss the science behind resilience, along with effective ways to react to change and other daily challenges.\nIn the first episode of the podcast\u2019s second season, we focus on creativity \u2014 specifically, how to recharge ourselves and maximize creativity during periods of high stress and transition. For this conversation, we were joined by digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush and associate professor of sport and performance psychology at Nottingham Trent University Dr. Mustafa Sarkar.\nWe\u2019re all striving to be our best, and often we equate that with being productive. Rahaf, you wrote a book called \u201cHustle and Float,\u201d which is a helpful concept for thinking about productivity. Can you explain it?\nRahaf Harfoush: \u201cHustle and float\u201d is a phrase borrowed from white-water rafting. It\u2019s the idea that, to have a good rafting trip, you need a mix of hustle and float. There\u2019s a period when you have to exert yourself to make the raft go where you want it to go, to move forward. But there are also periods when you have to lift your oar and let the river do the work. Too much of one or the other will ruin your trip. Too much hustle, and you\u2019ll get exhausted and make mistakes that can be dangerous. Too much float, and it\u2019s boring; you don\u2019t get where you want to go and are at the mercy of the river. The idea is that, in order to successfully navigate, we have to balance between when we do the work and when the river does the work. And that\u2019s easily applied to productivity culture: We\u2019re so accustomed to hustling, we don\u2019t remember how to float.\nCreativity helps solve big problems, which makes it a fundamental leadership capability we all need. Mustafa, when we consider team resilience, creativity is such a key part of navigating challenges and uncertainty. You study high-performance teams. What specifically have you noticed about managers and other leaders?\nMustafa Sarkar: Team learning is vital to resilience; teams that are on the same wavelength are better able to respond as a collective to difficult situations. Teams need time and space to perform in this way, and leaders are critical to shaping an environment and intentionally creating time and space for creativity. Effective leaders also have influence over the ideas that are generated.\nPrioritizing time and space for creativity is so important. But there\u2019s a misconception that prioritizing creativity comes at the expense of productivity. How do we overcome that to embrace the idea that focused work and detachment give teams a competitive advantage?\nHarfoush: Since we define productivity as continuous visual output, we tend to obsess over visible work performance. For most of us, the visible work \u2014 the presentation to the client, the final research report \u2014 is just a fraction of our process, maybe 25%. The remaining 75% is unseen, and so we think it\u2019s invisible to performance. And, from a resiliency perspective, we are accustomed to optimizing and getting drained as if it\u2019s an end state to be celebrated, rather than treating our creative energy as a sustainable resource to be renewed and replenished strategically.\nSarkar: There\u2019s an analogy about a cellphone battery: As humans, we often wait until we are at 5% energy to recharge, but we would never wait until our phone is at 5% battery power to charge it. We\u2019d probably start charging it at 30%. Why do we do it with our phones but not ourselves?\nWe know our best ideas and our best performance moments come after the rest, and we see that proven by professional athletes all the time. Why is it so hard to slow down?\nHarfoush: There\u2019s a myth that says your success is solely dependent on your ability to work hard. And that anytime you\u2019re not actively demonstrating that you\u2019re working hard, you are signaling that you\u2019re not deserving of your own success. In reality, we know that hard work can move the needle, yes, but there are so many other factors.\nSarkar: An important thing to consider when we talk about work devotion is identity and what fills your life outside of work. If you have multiple identities \u2014 if you\u2019re a father, a mother, a footballer, an exerciser, a cook, whatever it may be \u2014 you\u2019ll consider those aspects of your life very important. But if your identity is solely tied to work, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll see yourself and your success.\nOften there is a badge of honor around how hard we all work, especially among high performers. How can companies go about shifting that belief system?\nSarkar: Resilience is cultivated by design, not by default. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically, and that\u2019s why focusing on the work environment is so important. As a leader or manager, you must focus on proactively creating an environment where it is safe for people to speak up when they see things that aren\u2019t healthy, and creating opportunities where you can hold up your hand and acknowledge your own mistakes.\nHarfoush: To build on that, it\u2019s important to consider questions that contribute to environment: What does success look like here? What behaviors do we hold up as aspirational? How do we measure performance? How do we define performance?\nI also encourage clients to start with small experiments. Make hypotheses about what you think you can prove through experimentation. Maybe you\u2019ll see better strategic thinking and fewer mistakes when people aren\u2019t sleep deprived and overstressed. Get the data and build on what you learn.\nOne of the top questions we get from people managers at Google has been: What can I do now to increase my team\u2019s resilience and productivity down the road? What\u2019s your advice?\nSarkar: Resilience boils down to cultivating relationships, particularly because of remote and hybrid work. There\u2019s a saying that \u201cstrangers can\u2019t team,\u201d and many of us are in a situation now where we don\u2019t know our teammates. Working to cultivate relationships and shared values is more critical than ever.\nHarfoush: Productivity is a reflection of a system, and it can be anything that you want. So if you want to increase your team\u2019s productivity, then it\u2019s critical to specify what that means. Is it increased time for deep work? More periods of intense collaboration? Eliminating distractions through prioritization?\nAnother thing for managers to think about is anti-fragility \u2014 not just helping your team be productive and resilient through disruption, but using the disruption to grow and be better. As strategic thinkers, we have to be adaptive and responsive, and challenge assumptions and evolve. All of those things require a different relationship to change. So as leaders, we must really get to know ourselves, our creativity, our energy, and what drains and replenishes us.\nDownload and listen to the full conversation on Google Podcasts or wherever you find your favorite shows."

Also, highlight your product or service to help people instantly understand what you\u2019re showcasing.\nTo more accurately illustrate how your products or services work, upload the highest resolution images possible (1200x628, 960x1200, and 1200x1200 pixels) and consider using images that show people using your products. Based on an internal analysis with Creative Works (formerly Unskippable Labs), images with a person drive 4% more clicks compared to images without a person.1\nUse overlay text sparingly. It can have a varied appearance on different devices and create a less compelling experience for people scrolling through their feeds. Our internal analysis with Creative Works shows that, on average, images without overlay text drive 9% more clicks.2\nAudiences, messaging, and creative assets that have performed well for your other media campaigns, such as video or social, can help you unlock performance with highly engaged audiences on Discovery ads. Be sure to include at least 10 converting Search campaign keywords in each of your custom intent audiences, and make the most of Google\u2019s automated audience features: Advertisers who use audience expansion with Discovery ads see 52% more conversions at a comparable cost per acquisition to their originally selected audience.3\nIn summer 2020, U.K. fashion brand Ted Baker used its social ads creative assets to build Discovery campaigns, connecting with previous website visitors and shoppers interested in clothing. As a result, Ted Baker saw a revenue lift of 70% and a 62% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) in under one year.\nAutomated campaign types need the right budget, a variety of great assets, and enough time to analyze the performance of your ads to determine which settings for your creative assets and bids work the best across your audiences. Your campaign optimizes your settings for peak performance over time.\nIf you\u2019re running Discovery ads for the first time, give your campaign time and space to learn what works by choosing an average daily budget at least 10 times the value of your target cost-per-action bid. Then wait for at least 40 conversions before making any changes. Whenever you change your assets, audiences, or bids, your campaign will need two to three weeks to adjust and optimize for the best results.\nFor more detailed examples and tips for how to set up Discovery ads, check out our full best practices guide."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in the entertainment industry. Here, actor, author, and advocate Selma Blair explains why it\u2019s time for media to shift toward a world where everyone sees themselves represented and how to build belonging into media. A version of this article first appeared in Variety on July 19, 2022.\nStorytelling is powerful. Stories can ultimately shape your identity and how the world sees you.\nThroughout my life, my story has been told by other people: Manic depressive. Drunk. Mean.\nIn my memoir, \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I wrote about never feeling a sense of belonging. Throughout my life, I often felt disconnected from my body, out of control, as if I didn\u2019t belong in my own skin. I learned not to show or talk about pain because I didn\u2019t want it to define me, nor did I understand what my pain meant.\nIn 2018, I was finally able to tell other people how I identified myself: disabled. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and learned it had been attacking my central nervous system for years. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have anyone in the entertainment industry to look up to who had a disability or was open about their diagnosis, and I didn\u2019t see my experiences reflected in the stories being told on screen. Even though it was difficult learning I had MS, at least it had a name now. After being confused about who I was for so long, I finally understood myself \u2014 and I belonged to a community. In a way, it was also freeing.\nI started thinking more about the power of storytelling and why representation in media matters. If I had seen and heard from people who were like me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone. Perhaps if I\u2019d had more diverse representation to look up to, I would have learned about my own diagnosis earlier on (I was shocked when I learned one of my idols, Joan Didion, also had MS).\nNow I truly feel comfortable embracing all parts of my identity \u2014 including my disability \u2014 and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time we shift the story about how disabled people are represented. It\u2019s one of the reasons I started looking at the work Google has been doing to build inclusive practices into its marketing. United by shared values and a vision that authentically represents disabled people\u2019s stories, I want to help the rest of the creative industry use Google\u2019s learnings to build a world where everyone belongs.\nSince my diagnosis, I\u2019ve become close friends with Andra\u00e9a LaVant, a leading voice in the disability community and founder of LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and communications firm. I\u2019ve learned so much from her and her team and the work they\u2019ve been doing with brands, including how they\u2019ve supported Google to bring disability into its advertising and internal programs. All In, Google\u2019s inclusive marketing toolkit, draws on years of internal insights and collaborations to build intentionality into every step of its advertising process.\nIn partnership with LaVant Consulting and many other leading organizations, Google launched an accessible marketing playbook on All In as a practical guide for every marketing effort. This is such a powerful resource for so many reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s informed by the lived experiences of people with disabilities.\nThis approach deeply reflects a core principle in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. Who better to build a strong sense of belonging for disabled people than we who belong to the community?\nWhile I want to use my voice to support the disability community, I also strongly believe that I can\u2019t be the only spokesperson for everyone with a disability. Our experience is ours alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pull in as many people and experts from the community as possible.\nIn addition to LaVant Consulting, Google has worked with Disability:IN, GLAAD, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Ad Council, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (The 4A\u2019s), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, Cannes Lions, and many other expert organizations across the world to create All In and contribute to Google\u2019s continued inclusivity practice.\nThis level of collaboration creates space for the more than 1 billion disabled people around the world. It also acknowledges that each person has a unique background and set of circumstances. My disability is just one identity, and my experience is just that \u2014 one person\u2019s experience. Disability will touch everyone at some point in their life, whether permanent, temporary, visible, invisible, or age related. Partnering with diverse experts and perspectives also emphasizes the opportunity to consider people\u2019s whole identities, including gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education.\nThis matters beyond advertising, All In\u2019s original focus. There is a movement happening, and the entertainment industry needs to be a part of this cultural shift. Everyone benefits from accessibility, because it opens up work to a wider, more diverse audience.\nI\u2019ve already learned a lot through the accessible marketing playbook on All In; it would have been a helpful resource while I was writing \u201cMean Baby.\u201d For example, throughout my memoir I described people as \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair.\u201d The playbook suggests that a more inclusive description would be \u201cwheelchair user\u201d or \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d This is a great example of something that may seem small, yet is so impactful.\nAll In also taught me that disability inclusion is a mindset, not a box to check. It requires a sustained commitment, a constantly evolving work process, and ongoing learning for each and every one of us. This is important for us to remember if we\u2019re to make meaningful change.\nIn \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I write that the thing about limitations is that they aren\u2019t really about you at all. They\u2019re often constructed by others, and when they\u2019re removed, you realize that all this time you\u2019ve been capable of soaring.\nThe entertainment industry has the ability to do so much to help tear down these limitations. Committing to accessibility breaks down barriers, enabling creatives to be better in their work. It\u2019s time for the wider creative media industry to commit to inclusion and elevate the significance of this growing cultural shift. Everyone deserves to have their story represented authentically and feel a sense of belonging.\nWhether you\u2019re a producer, creator, marketer, or actor, All In is for you. These are steps anybody can take today. Commit to helping change the creative industry to be more inclusive by learning how on Google.com/All-In."

        "output": "Data analytics should be top of mind for every advertiser, but building a successful and effective analytics team can be challenging. Here, Google marketing and analytics leaders break down key principles businesses can use to realize the potential of a tech-savvy analytics team.\nDigital transformation \u2014 the process of using digital technologies to modernize business performance, agility, and sustainability \u2014 is widely seen by marketing leaders as the key to future-proofing organizations. To get the most out of digital innovations, companies must be able to pinpoint where to focus their efforts and to understand what strategies are working best. That\u2019s why a strong data analytics team that can communicate real-time data insights to the C-suite is crucial to driving meaningful digital transformation.\nCompanies that build a successful analytics team are more likely to see revenue, profit, and market share gains.1 Yet, according to the Digital Maturity Benchmark, only 9% of businesses use insights and technology effectively to create better consumer experiences. Why?\nThrough Google\u2019s own experience building world-leading analytics teams and our work with hundreds of other companies, we\u2019ve identified three core principles that can help businesses overcome challenges and build successful analytics strategies and teams.\nWhen it comes to investing in your organization\u2019s analytics, prioritize people over tools. Investing in people leads to a flexible analytics capability, which can adapt to a changing business environment without locking the organization into an unwieldy system of software and tools.\nWhile many Fortune 500 companies have made great investments in analytics tools, most still struggle to make meaningful data-driven business decisions. That\u2019s largely because this investment strategy makes the mistake of thinking that tools, rather than people, are the solution to building better analytics. The tools themselves can only go so far without the right people behind them.\nThese misplaced efforts led us to develop a 10/90 rule for web analytics success: Invest 10% of the analytics budget in tools and the remaining 90% in people. For example, if you\u2019re paying a web analytics vendor $25,000 for an annual contract, you should be prepared to invest a further $225,000 in people to get meaningful value from that data.\nTo be sure, software systems and vendor professional services are important components of a successful analytics team. But it\u2019s the analysts, not the tools, who transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the 10/90 rule, CxOs can draw on the winning combination of computer processing power and human judgment to inform marketing activities and business decisions, and understand consumer behaviors.\nAnalytics teams thrive in dynamic environments that reward curiosity, encourage innovation, and set high expectations. Building and reinforcing this type of culture can help put organizations on a path to earning impactful returns from analytics investments.\nAn active analytics culture thrives when CxOs reward curiosity over perfection. Encourage analysts to challenge convention and ask questions as a method to improve quality and reduce risks. This thinking goes hand in hand with a test-and-learn mentality, where pushing boundaries through proactive experimentation helps identify what works, and optimize accordingly.\nIt\u2019s also important to create a culture where failure and success are celebrated equally. Giving airtime to what went wrong allows the team to more effectively learn from their mistakes and see that perfection is an unhealthy pipe dream. This encourages an environment that holds analysts accountable for delivering quality processes and results, further helping to mitigate risk and improve marketing programs.\nHigh-performing analytics capabilities cannot and will not happen without the full commitment of an organization\u2019s senior leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that leaders collaborate with analysts to understand the data behind decision-making.\nC-level leaders can create an analytics-friendly environment by knowing when to collect data, presenting business challenges to analyst teams, and consistently seeking to quantify goals and objectives. Leading by example, data-savvy CxOs can show leaders that it\u2019s better to go to analyst teams with problems to solve rather than requests for specific deliverables, championing these non-analysts to be experts in their distinct businesses \u2014 rather than analytics.\nMaintaining a winning analytics capability requires endorsement up and down an organization. This sets the tone for a company that values understanding measurement solutions as well as the problem-solving expertise analysts can deliver across the organization.\nNow\u2019s the time for businesses to establish a data-centric culture that positions them to win with analytics today and in the future. Companies that do it are more effective and efficient, earn impactful insights from their data, and can attract and retain top-tier analytics talent.\nSo start laying the foundation for your company\u2019s in-house data analytics infrastructure immediately. Audit your organization\u2019s current analytics capabilities to identify gaps and opportunities in your marketing strategy. Then, identify what leadership you need to close gaps in capability and design by successfully implementing the principles we\u2019ve shared.\nBuild your organization\u2019s own high-performing analytics team, and join the future-ready businesses that are taking their marketing further."

Agency teams around the globe have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to keep delivering effective work for their clients, whose businesses are pivoting and adapting to change.\nAgencies are adapting to their own business changes too \u2014 from new COVID-safe production protocols to ideating from home and being separated from creative teammates. This new dynamic for creative work raises challenges, but also opportunities to shine. All of that makes the 2021 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity a welcome moment to pause and reflect on the power of creativity, which not even a pandemic can stop.\nTo provide creative inspiration for your next brief, we\u2019ve curated great work from Google\u2019s platforms that\u2019s on the Cannes Lions 2021 shortlists to date.\nShortlisted for both the Titanium Lions and Glass Lion for Change, this category-busting campaign has broken every clich\u00e9 in advertising period products. Feminine hygiene brands have used blue liquid and women wearing white jeans or bikinis as the \u201cacceptable\u201d way to advertise their products for decades. Not anymore. Raw, confronting, but sensitive and sympathetic, this 3-minute TrueView ad is crafted with exceptional detail and authenticity, stemming from an insight-led creative development process. While maximizing the benefits of TrueView\u2019s long-form format, tight pacing ensures not a single frame is wasted.\nIn 2020, Think with Google profiled AMV BBDO\u2019s creative team who brought #wombpainstories to life, in Episode 4 of Meet the Makers.\n\nShortlisted for the Titanium Lions, this powerful campaign cuts straight to the heart, questioning the dichotomy of a world that can celebrate Black culture and creativity, while allowing racial injustice and inequality to persist. The all-star cast delivers intense, lingering stares straight to the camera, silently breaking the fourth wall and leveraging the personal nature of the YouTube viewing experience.\n\nShortlisted for the Titanium Lions, Dove unmasked beauty with static imagery. Standing out from other brands during the pandemic, the use of arresting images of the damage done by masks to healthcare workers\u2019 faces evokes empathy, while the simple production technique speaks to the raw and sometimes brutal nature of the important work done by the subjects. The sound-on YouTube experience includes a simple piano track, completing a mesmerizing spot.\n\nShortlisted for the Film Craft Lions, The Look addresses ingrained prejudice towards the Black community by shining a spotlight on the microaggressions they face every day. By switching between first and third person point-of-view, the viewer gets a genuine taste of what it's like to be pre-judged by your skin color.

        "input": "",
        "output": "While some brands are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their messaging and marketing campaigns, an essential component of inclusivity may be missing: accessibility.\nIt's especially important to cater to people who are typically underserved in the digital world. For example, people who are blind or have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, are neurodivergent, or those who have motor conditions. These individuals often face barriers when an experience is not properly designed. Online journeys are often convoluted experiences for people, and brands need to ensure their apps and websites don\u2019t add further complications.\nBuilding accessible user experiences will soon become a regulatory requirement too. This year, European Union member states are adopting the European Accessibility Act into their laws. The expectation is that all products and online services will need to be accessible once the requirements come into force in 2025.\nSo where do you start on your accessibility journey? We\u2019ve spoken with four brands about how they think about and build for accessibility and disability inclusiveness. Here\u2019s what we learned.\nAdvertising is powerful because it connects with people through storytelling. But what if someone misses key elements of that story? This question led consumer goods manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G) to incorporate audio description, a voice-over describing what\u2019s happening, into their video ads.\n\u201cThe introduction of audio description stems from my personal experiences,\u201d explains Sam Latif, company accessibility leader at P&G, who is blind. \u201cI was in a meeting when an ad for Flash played, but all I could hear was the song \u2018Flash\u2019 by Queen. What I didn\u2019t realize was that a dog was singing that song, because, without audio description, I couldn\u2019t understand the humor of the ad.\u201d\nThe P&G team worked with The Royal National Institute of Blind People to learn how audio description is done and integrated it into its ads.\nP&G didn\u2019t stop there. In 2021, they launched the first audio-described Super Bowl ad. It also ran its first adaptive audio description trial in the U.K. This means applying audio description to TV ads that don\u2019t have enough natural gaps in the dialogue to provide a description. And, most recently, it added audio description to its YouTube channel.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have all the answers but are proud of the progress we have made,\u201d says Latif. \u201cExperiences like this have led to change, with audio description opening up our advertising to millions more people around the world.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway conducts research directly with people with disabilities, from customers who are blind or have low vision to those with nonvisible disabilities, such as dyslexia. Its goal: understand people\u2019s first-hand experiences when using the delivery app and build inclusive products.\n\u201cObserving people with access needs using our app has been a strong facilitator of change and awareness across the organization,\u201d says Naoil Sbai, a global research team lead at the company. \u201cIt helped us realize the impact that simple changes could make. And it made us rethink how people interact with our app.\u201d\nThis motivated the research team to identify optimization opportunities with the Android Accessibility Scanner. The automated tool flagged key recommendations, such as increasing the size of touch targets \u2014 the tappable space around a navigation button.\nOnce this issue was known, it took them just a day to make the touch targets bigger. Something seemingly small \u2014 and a quick fix \u2014 can make a world of difference to customers, especially those with limited dexterity. And, as a bonus, this makes it easier for anyone to order their food quickly while on-the-go.\nL'Or\u00e9al had accessibility front of mind when building its new website. \u201cThe first step toward accessibility is to understand the different types of disabilities and how they affect millions of people,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Cunche, the beauty company\u2019s digital project director.\nWhen it learned how customers with low vision and cognitive conditions use the website, it set out to raise awareness within the company. It adopted the industry-standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to improve the website experience. And it partnered with an agency that specializes in this topic to help implement the guidelines across the business.\nWith the basic foundations in place, the product team took it one step further by layering on additional features. For example, they now offer accessibility controls in the website navigation menu, so people can select settings based on their needs.\nThe first feature is high-contrast mode. This removes background images and allows people to view the site in a strong white-on-black contrast, making it easier to read and focus on the content.\nThe team also added an option to deactivate animations to reveal a static header image on the page instead. This can help people with vestibular disorders, for whom motion can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea.\n\u201cAfter several tests and user surveys, all results are very positive and encourage us to go further,\u201d continues Cunche. \u201cWith knowledge comes responsibility, and only then can we create a better digital experience \u2014 for everyone.\u201d\nBooking.com is a large and complex organization, with many teams working on different elements of the digital travel company\u2019s app. As different people, code, and designs feed into the app, some features don\u2019t always behave as they should.\nFor example, during testing, the accessibility team found that some navigational tabs were not working correctly with screen readers \u2014 software that reads visual information from the screen out loud. In some instances, the screen reader would read out the wrong tab. Someone wanting to navigate to the \u201cCar Rentals\u201d section could be accidentally directed to the \u201cTaxis\u201d page.\nThe accessibility team partnered with the design systems team to update the components \u2014 the building blocks within an app \u2014 so that accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, were built in from the start.\n\u201cIf we use components that are accessible by default, we can innovate and be agile, without having to focus on getting it right all the time, every time,\u201d explains Booking.com Engineering Manager and Accessibility Lead Parham Doustdar. Doustdar has been blind since birth and is an expert at navigating websites and apps with screen readers, so this accessibility issue was very familiar to him.\nHowever, this work didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, because some legacy components did not reflect the changes. The team partnered with another group in their organization to update the technology so the accessibility changes could be adopted throughout the entire app. Now, as pages are built and updated, everyone working on the app automatically uses components that have accessibility built in.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter how accessible your components are if no one is using them,\u201d continues Doustdar. \u201cYou have to harness existing initiatives, where possible, and partner with other teams to increase adoption.\u201d\nHere are some final tips to help you improve accessibility.\nAnd, above all, know that people\u2019s varied needs continue to change, so you\u2019re never finished creating more accessible user experiences. The most important thing is to start."

        "output": "Ben Jones is the global director of Google's Creative Works, a newly formed team with the mission of helping brands drive better business results with more effective creative.\nNo matter what tools or technology you have at your disposal, good creative is the last unfair advantage of ads that work. It\u2019s only natural that marketing and creative teams develop their own \u201crules\u201d about what makes for effective creative on YouTube ads. We often find that those rules could benefit from a reframe. The truth is, successful brands on YouTube use creative strategies and mindsets that bust assumptions. Here are a few misperceptions we've encountered and some suggestions for how you might reframe them into best practices for YouTube ad creative.\nYou should absolutely take risks on YouTube. But that doesn\u2019t mean shooting in the dark to find what works. There are some basic principles to making effective YouTube ads, and these principles can inform which risks are worth taking. The ABCDs of effective creative on YouTube are based on years of research on tens of thousands of ads from all over the world to uncover which specific creative elements contribute to the biggest impact on YouTube.\nAds that follow the ABCDs as a guide have been shown to yield 30% lift in short-term sales likelihood and 17% lift in long-term brand contribution.1 There\u2019s still plenty of room to build creatively on those foundations, but keeping them in mind will better equip you to take those risks and make more effective creative choices.\nWhile there are certainly creative principles you can start with, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to execution. Looking at the wide spectrum of effective YouTube ads across marketing objectives around the world, we\u2019ve found that focusing on what your ad says and how it makes people feel is more important than the way your ad looks.\nEffective YouTube ads can be many things, like an episodic docu-series, an undercover investigation, a user-narrated product review, or an interview with the CEO. It can be a music video partnership with a YouTube creator that becomes the No. 1 most-watched video in the world in its first 24 hours, leading to a 100% increase in year-over-year sales. It can even be an anime series starring the product as the hero, which sells out immediately, beats the team\u2019s KPIs, and boosts year-over-year product sales by more than 100%.\nYouTube is a breeding ground for creativity, and advertisers have as much of an opportunity to participate in that as anyone else on the platform. Effective ads give viewers a taste of your brand, product, or service \u2014 and that leaves a lot of room for creativity.\nSometimes ads that are meant to drive action get a bad rap. There\u2019s concern that lower-funnel ads cheapen the story or sell the brand short. But we\u2019ve seen brands get really creative with calls to action. It just requires thinking about the ad as the start of the viewer\u2019s next action, allowing the work to extend beyond that one impression. This is especially important on YouTube where 63% of viewers in the markets we\u2019ve studied say they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on the platform.2\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, AR, AU, BR, CA, CL, CO, FR, IT IN, JP, MX, PE, KR, ES, U.K., U.S., Why Video study, n=32075, A18-64 gen pop video users, March 2020\u2013Aug. 2020.\nA creative way to customize lower-funnel ads is to align with the viewer\u2019s passion points and make a more directed offer. Or you could employ a bit of reverse psychology like McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia did, when the team told viewers not to search for a product, knowing that would spark curiosity and encourage them to do just that.\nGucci U.K. got creative with ad sequencing to hone in on viewers most interested in its products as part of its holiday season campaign. Partnering with filmmaker Harmony Korine, the team produced a colorful, nostalgia-tinged video ad. With ad sequencing, they first raised awareness by featuring a campaign teaser video that led to the full director's cut on YouTube. Then, to increase consideration, Gucci showed a 6-second bumper ad series to viewers who showed interest in the teaser. Finally, the brand served product-focused ads to those viewers using TrueView for action and TrueView for shopping ads that connected them directly with the link to purchase. The campaign itself was viewed 5.4 million times globally with a 58% view completion rate, and it drove 44.5K clicks to Gucci\u2019s website.\nThere\u2019s a difference between having an experimental approach to creating video ads and conducting a one-off test. The former is a mindset that reaps deep learnings and keeps you from relying on long-held assumptions. The latter is a thing you do every once in a while, and works best for campaign-specific learnings.\nAn experimental mindset doesn\u2019t have to slow you down or cost you more, and it will pay off in the long term. Think of every campaign your brand puts out there as an experiment. See what you learn, which new questions emerge, and what needs to be optimized. Advertisers who successfully used Video Experiments saw 60% higher ad recall from the better performing creative.3\nSource: Google Data, Global, Successful Video Experiments were those with a significant difference in Brand Lift between experiment arms, 2019\u20132020.\nStart by changing one variable (big or small), like simple edits to the pace, the framing of your opening shot, or a variety of copy tweaks. Even the smallest changes can make a big impact. The more you experiment, the more you will understand not only what levers to pull creatively for your brand, but deeper insights about your audience.\nAspiration, a digital banking alternative focused on social good, has taken an experimental mindset when it comes to video creative. The team consistently tests through the entire production process. They run ads with variants of headlines, calls to action, and even landing pages to fully optimize their creative for success. By running different versions and looking at Brand Lift and Search lift results, they\u2019re able to determine the more effective creative to put their weight behind. Thanks to these optimizations and experiments, Aspiration was able to drive a 25% lift in relative brand awareness, over 16,000 email leads, and more than 3,400 new users.\nCreating assets tailored for each platform usually requires more lift than most brands and creative teams can spare. What we\u2019ve found is that when you start with a digital audience in mind, by grabbing attention immediately; building for mobile with tighter framing, large-type text, and color contrast for visibility on smaller screens; and with sound on, your ads will perform better everywhere, including on TV.\nThen for YouTube in particular, layer on some of its specific capabilities like personalizing your video ads at scale, like the Greek pizza chain Pizza Fan, or transforming a TV spot into a multipart video ad using ad sequencing, like LinkedIn U.K.\nIn its first ever brand-led campaign, LinkedIn U.K. had a beautiful 60-second TV spot. The team devised a test. They would run the TV spot on YouTube to see how it performed, and they would also run tailored-for-YouTube assets: four separate short-form videos that featured a large on-screen logo, with sound on, and sequenced together to serve to viewers over time. Hands down, the YouTube-tailored assets performed better. \u201cWe saw increased consideration by 20%, ad recall up 178%, and a campaign that was 2.3X more cost efficient in driving brand lift,\u201d said Katriona O\u2019Leary, the brand\u2019s group manager for paid media.\nGreat brands around the world are constantly pushing to rethink long-held assumptions about what works on YouTube. Follow the foundational principles of effective creative, think creatively, build for digital, and take advantage of the capabilities YouTube offers \u2014 all with an experimental mindset \u2014 and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making effective video ad creative.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio. Create with Google curates the creative insight, inspiration, and tools you need to make effective creative work \u2014 all in one place."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dorothea Wiesmann Rothuizen and Wojtek Skut are engineers at Google, where they work on continually improving AI and large language models. They are a part of the team implementing new capabilities into Google Ads features, such as broad match.\nThere\u2019s been a wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, largely due to immense improvements in the underlying technology. Large language models (LLMs), for example, now enable a deeper understanding of language, which has led to conversations with AI that are much more natural and intuitive.\nThis same technology has supercharged broad match, a Google Ads setting that helps brands reach more people with their ads and reduces manual keyword work.\nWhile broad match has existed since the dawn of Google Ads, its early version wasn\u2019t perfect and began losing momentum about 15 years ago. Back then, it could have matched a search query, such as \u201ctreating a pet at home,\u201d to an irrelevant keyword, like \u201ctreats for pets.\u201d At the same time, \u201ctreating a pet at home\u201d would not have matched to the related \u201cwithout a vet,\u201d since the two phrases don\u2019t contain any of the same words. But, thanks to new advances in AI and continuous updates, broad match has evolved and can now better interpret nuance and context.\nIn fact, today\u2019s broad match understands people\u2019s search queries on a deeper level and can identify keyword search intent. This makes it one of the most effective solutions for search advertising.\nBelieve it or not, when broad match first launched, Google\u2019s engineering team would manually write out the synonyms for a keyword and cast a really wide net. For example, an ad keyword including \u201ccheap\u201d could match with searches for \u201cinexpensive\u201d and \u201cshoestring.\u201d While \u201cshoestring\u201d can be a different way of saying \u201cbudget,\u201d a user could alternatively use this word to search for shoelaces.\nThanks to new AI capabilities, LLMs can now better understand a user\u2019s search intent. We train them with billions of pieces of text so they can learn all the different variations and meanings of a word or phrase, and what sequences make sense. Once that fundamental foundation is in place, we will assign the AI a specific task, like matching ads to search queries.\nWhile the language technology can understand the potential demand that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s most effective when combined with Smart Bidding. This automated bidding strategy factors in a wide range of signals and surrounding data points in a privacy-safe way \u2014 such as search history, interests, and past purchases \u2014 to build a predictive model that helps advertisers identify the audiences most likely to convert.\nHere are three of the most significant improvements we\u2019ve made to broad match.\nIn the early days of broad match, the technology would connect the dots between keywords in a search query and an ad, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the order of the words in the query into account.\nFor instance, someone looking for a flight from London to Paris could have been shown an ad for a flight from Paris to London. To prevent this from happening, Google\u2019s search specialists would\u2019ve recommended a different keyword strategy to those advertisers. But today, broad match knows that going from A to B isn\u2019t the same as going from B to A. This improvement has also been applied to other areas where a search query only works one way.\nHere\u2019s an example. A user might be looking for a place to \u201cexchange euros to pounds\u201d or searching for a \u201cusb to usbc cable,\u201d and seeing an ad in which these words are in reverse order would not be relevant to them. Fortunately, the latest version of broad match now understands their search intent.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve often been asked: \u201cWhat happens when two ads for the same advertiser match to the same search query?\u201d Previously, broad match would have looked at an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank to help determine which ad to show, but which may not always have been the best choice.\nTo improve relevance \u2014 for advertisers and users \u2014 today\u2019s broad match considers supporting information, such as other keywords in the ad group and even the ad\u2019s landing page. And, thanks to the increased capabilities of the LLM that powers broad match, it better understands the meaning of a search query and its variations to improve relevance there too.\nMultilingual search is a third area that has seen a lot of development. Broad match now recognizes that some people might switch between languages when looking for something online, and it uses that information to serve the right ads.\nThe expat community is a common use case. For example, Turkish people living in the Netherlands or British people residing in Spain may be searching in their first language but looking for local-language results for the country they live in.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that running your campaign in one language means that you\u2019ll get traffic for other languages, since campaign success still relies on language settings and localized creative. But, in countries where many people are bilingual, it\u2019s helpful to know that broad match can match relevant, local traffic to an ad, even when the search is made in another language.\nBroad match may not be quite as old as \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d but it\u2019s been around for a long time. And, just like in the iconic 1985 movie, it shows us that sometimes looking at something from the past helps you understand its value in the present.\nThat said, while AI-powered language upgrades have made broad match far more effective for search advertising, it will continue to need a smart marketer in the driver\u2019s seat. Savvy marketers will check performance, select the right bidding strategy, and monitor new queries identified by broad match to bring in new customers. After all, you might discover new insights about your audience throughout the campaign.\nAI learns from you, and you learn from AI. Broad match\u2019s success depends on the team that uses it, just like the time-traveling car from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d needed the input and creativity from its creator, Doc Brown, to drive into the past \u2014 and the future.Tune into the Google Marketing Platform Partner Podcast episode \u201cTalking AI: How a deeper language understanding is transforming broad match\u201d to hear more about the ways large language models are supercharging broad match.

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s business environment, planning ahead simply isn\u2019t enough. Marketers need to balance early planning with an ability to pivot. Especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty when budgets are under pressure, marketing and finance teams must work together even more closely to effectively deploy resources and maximize ROI.\nAn ingrained benefit of digital marketing has always been the ability to quickly change media plans and constantly optimize. More than ever, marketers have to lean into an agile mindset to shift budgets to the biggest opportunities. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy task.\nIn my past CMO roles at Calvin Klein Inc. and L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, I remember how often industry media buying platforms were distinctly siloed by channel: search, online video, display, social, and more. These silos carried over to our budget and organizational structures, creating friction and inefficiency whenever we tried to optimize performance across many marketing channels.\nBut as technology and solutions like AI and machine learning have rapidly improved, so have opportunities to show up for customers in more connected and consistent ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a multiplying force for businesses. You can more precisely scale your marketing presence across channels, stay on top of consumer needs and trends, and achieve new levels of agility within your marketing.\nThese opportunities are empowering marketers to rethink their old approaches to multichannel digital campaigns to improve ROI. To better understand this shift, Google partnered with Kantar to survey over 2,400 global marketers and explore the importance of agility in planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels. From this study, we\u2019ve identified three core areas that require a careful balancing act to unlock greater agility and developed guiding principles for success.\nWhile initial budget planning is considered fundamental, marketers should also leave room for flexibility. In our study, marketers are considered behaviorally budget agile if they adjust budgets across digital channels on a weekly or more frequent basis. Based on this metric, nearly a quarter of the marketers surveyed are considered budget agile.1\nBudget agile does not, however, mean unprepared. Thirty-one percent of budget-agile marketers engage in formal marketing planning to align on strategy and digital-media budget allocations every month versus 18% of non-agile marketers.2\nBeing budget agile can also lead to better business outcomes. Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 And 48% of budget-agile marketers state that their marketing performance exceeded internal expectations and marketing KPIs, compared to 33% of marketers who are not budget agile.4\nThis finding did surprise us: Many of the marketers surveyed considered themselves more budget agile than they actually are based on their budgeting behaviors. On average, 60% of marketers who say they are \u201cextremely agile\u201d only make budget adjustments across digital channels monthly or less frequently.5\nWhile this gap between perception and actual behavior happens at all levels of an organization, C-level executives are 2X more likely than individual contributors to perceive their business as extremely budget agile.6\nThe disconnect between perceived and actual budget agility reveals that there\u2019s room for improvement across organizations. For me personally, empowering my teams to work with greater agility means I need to step back and allow them to make faster decisions. But this isn\u2019t the case for many businesses. Indeed, the budget approval process is quite lengthy for 54% of non-agile marketers, where changes to digital budgets of 20% or more take a month or longer for approval.7 And even agile marketers must deal with time-consuming approvals. For 59% of budget-agile marketers, changes to digital budget of 20% or more take a week or longer for approval.8\nMarketers also face heavy oversight and scrutiny over budget changes and reallocations. Fifty-two percent of marketers say that executive or C-level individuals have a heavy influence on budget adjustments after the initial planning period.9\nFortunately, our research shows that companies don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes to become more budget agile. Even brands and agencies that invest in dedicated channel expertise and specialist teams can still achieve quick wins to drive better collaboration and results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to break down organizational silos. Fifty-eight percent of marketers have created more cross-channel team touchpoints, such as meetings, training, and information sharing to improve collaboration.10 And, compared to their non-agile peers, budget-agile marketers are twice as likely to call their marketing across channels \u201cvery tightly integrated.\u201d11\nThey\u2019re also leaning into their agency partnerships to stay on the cutting edge. Agencies can help encourage an agile mindset when it comes to budgeting and breaking down organizational silos.\nForty-two percent of budget-agile marketers say their agency partners greatly influence adjustments they make after initial budget planning, compared to only 31% of non-agile marketers.12\nNext, more teams are setting shared goals that allow them to take a results-first rather than a channel-first approach. This starts with implementing consistent measurement and success metrics that help marketers align on a common language, even when they work on different channels. In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed have instituted shared metrics and KPIs across channels to improve collaboration.13\nMarketers are also relying on Google AI to maximize budget agility across channels in real time. Budget-agile marketers are 29% more likely than non-agile marketers to use cross-channel automation.14\nOne example of this is demonstrated by the global streaming service Discovery+, which adopted Performance Max to improve how the brand optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. Regina Sommese, group vice president of paid media and global subscriber acquisitions at Discovery+, says, \u201cBeing budget fluid has always been critical for us, but the process has historically been manual. Performance Max allowed us to move away from managing siloed campaigns to one holistic optimization approach.\u201d\nAs global brands like Discovery+ have found, driving reliable results and creating a culture of experimentation don\u2019t have to be at odds. In fast-changing environments, marketers who can strike the right balance between investing in proven strategies and funding experiments that unlock new opportunities will deliver long-term growth. In fact, 31% of budget-agile marketers say it\u2019s \u201cvery easy\u201d to get additional budget to start new tests that weren\u2019t included in the initial media budget, compared to just 9% of non-agile marketers.15\nIn times of uncertainty, it can also be a natural instinct to become more conservative and pull back on marketing budgets. Only 17% of budget-agile marketers and 6% of non-agile marketers have channels with uncapped or unlimited budgets that make it easy to increase budgets for new opportunities.16\nInside Google\u2019s own marketing team, we\u2019re taking the exact opposite approach. We\u2019ve partnered with our finance teams to prove the incremental value of marketing by aligning marketing goals with real business outcomes, like profitability and customer lifetime value. We also reforecast our global budgets regularly to ensure that we can request more funds if we have room to scale successful tests against finance-approved ROI thresholds. This gives us greater freedom to avoid artificial \u201ccaps\u201d on digital media budgets that can limit our ability to improve results.\nAgile marketers help their teams move faster, pivot to take advantage of new performance opportunities, and ultimately drive more business growth. By finding the right balance across budget agility, cross-channel team collaboration, and experimentation, marketers can invest their resources more effectively to maximize ROI."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in advertising. Here, KR Liu, Google\u2019s head of brand accessibility, shares her personal story and why accessible marketing is critical for every brand.\nI am female, queer, and disabled. For much of my life, these parts of my identity were rarely, if ever, authentically represented in media and advertising. This made me feel different, unvalued, and alone. As a result, I spent more than a decade hiding who I was in my personal life and at work.\nThen, a few years ago, I began to recognize that each part of my identity was essential and that no one part could exist without the other. It was the first time I felt as though people cared about all of me, rather than only my disability. That feeling was transformative.\nSadly, many others can relate to my experience of not feeling fully seen and represented in society, or in brand advertising. Great ads should reflect everyone, including the 1 billion people worldwide who identify as disabled and control 8 trillion dollars in spending. They should also acknowledge intersectionality, because like me, every disabled person has many dimensions to their identity that make them, them.\nSource: The World Bank, Global, April 2022.\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a day job that focuses on improving the accessibility of Google\u2019s marketing for our billions of users. While accessibility has always been core to our company\u2019s mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 being truly accessible is a journey, and we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to improve, and we are hoping to help other brands improve too.\nA year ago, we shared Google.com/All-In, an inclusive marketing toolkit for brands and agencies. Today, I\u2019m excited to share that All In now includes an all-new playbook on accessible marketing, which we developed in partnership with LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN, and has been endorsed by the American Association of Ad Agencies, Ad Council, Cannes Lions, and many other leading organizations.\nThe playbook has meaningfully guided our marketing this past year, and is the result of yearslong research and collaboration across many accessibility topics \u2014 from web experience to authentic depictions of people with disabilities. We\u2019re sharing it publicly with the hope it will improve the representation of disabled people in the media and help create work that is fully accessible. And, here, I\u2019m sharing three core principles from the playbook, with hope that it will inspire you to visit All In to learn more.\nDisabled people are their own experts, which is why it\u2019s so important to bring in their voices from the start. Often this involves dedicating the resources required to do accessible marketing right, such as training and support for internal teams.\nFor many companies, this may also involve leaning on a specialized third party for guidance. At Google, we sought out partnerships with several experts in disability inclusion, including LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN. Partnerships like these allow you show allyship and engage directly with the disabled community, which helps to expand the ideas that fuel your work.\nFor marketing to feel truly inclusive and accessible, brands must think about people with disabilities holistically, and consider the full spectrum of markers that comprise identity. Beyond disability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education level are just a few of the additional ways that people may identify themselves.\nFailing to recognize and reflect intersectionality in your messages runs the risk of reducing disabled people\u2019s multidimensional identities into oversimplified stories that can perpetuate stereotypes, rather than uplifting them. An excellent rule of thumb is to always opt for nuanced narratives, preferably ones that come directly from the people who are part of the narrative.\nOne example of this is our campaign, \u201cA CODA Story,\u201d which shares the multigenerational personal experience of Tony Lee, an Asian American Googler and a child of deaf adults (CODA). The film portrays Lee and his family as they bridge gaps in distance and communication during the pandemic by using Google\u2019s assistive technologies.\nBest practices for disability inclusion and accessibility marketing change over time as technology evolves and culture shifts. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey that depends heavily on the needs of people with disabilities. Like other forms of inclusion, accessibility should be a constant commitment that\u2019s embedded into every aspect of your brand campaigns \u2014 from conception to execution, and beyond.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on accessible marketing, but we recognize that there\u2019s plenty of work ahead. Achieving our accessibility goals is a continual process, and we are perpetually learning from it.\nOne thing we\u2019ve proved over and over again is that accessibility and disability inclusive marketing are good for all people, and the benefits don\u2019t stop there. When everyone can fully access and engage with your products, content, and experiences, it\u2019s good for business. Brands that prioritize this concept as a human and business imperative will find that it opens up their work to a more diverse audience. Committing to accessibility in marketing breaks down barriers and enables brands to be better in their work, which is better for all users.\nTogether, we can drive a cultural shift that represents and celebrates people with disabilities as their whole selves. A world where everyone can see themselves is one where everyone has what they need to thrive."

        "input": "",
        "output": "No\u00ebl Paasch, creative director at Google\u2019s Creative Works, leads brand and agency partnerships to determine best practices in advertising on YouTube. Here, she shares results from over two years of research to better understand the effectiveness of food, beverage, and restaurant video ads.\nShould your opening shot feature a satisfied customer enjoying your product mid-bite? Should it set the scene, steadily leading up to the product reveal?\nWhen it comes to creative decisions for video ads, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish pure aesthetics from what drives results. Without hard data, it\u2019s impossible to understand the psychology behind viewers\u2019 responses.\nOur ABCDs for creative effectiveness are data-informed, tested guidelines that can be applied universally to any video ad. In fact, Nielsen found that food, beverage, and restaurant ads that closely followed the ABCDs saw, on average, 31% higher sales lift.1 Supported by third-party research, our team recently conducted additional analyses to uncover more actionable creative insights around food ads. Here\u2019s what they found.\nThe experience of food is so much more than just its taste. A chocolate chip cookie is just as much its salty-sweet, fresh-from-the-oven smell, iconic craggy texture, and gooey chocolate melting on your fingers as it is its flavor. Our analysis shows that you can engage both sight and sound to make up for the lack of other sensory details.\nTake Magnum Ruby\u2019s ad, for example. When the protagonist takes a big bite of the chocolate-coated ice cream, the sound effect of the chocolate layer shattering evokes the experience of biting into a Magnum ice cream. Together, sight and sound are more compelling than either sense would be alone, summoning the memory of smell and taste.\nIt goes without saying that texture plays a big role in the characterization of any food. Would fresh pizza be as appealing without its gooey cheese or soft, bready crust?\nResearch shows that the majority of viewers watch ads on their mobile devices, so conveying the full visual through close-up shots of the product is extra important. Clear, crisp visuals help to communicate the product benefit quickly. This is generally good advice for any vertical on YouTube, but especially for food, beverage, and restaurant brands.\nC\u00f4te d'Or used this technique to great effect in their holiday ad. In each shot of the product, the chocolate takes up the full screen. The sheen of its smooth exterior and the grooves of the nut filling are so vivid, the viewer may as well have the product in front of them.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much one ad can show of the product itself. With limited time, shorter-form ads are perfect for focusing solely on the product, but studies show that long-form ads are more effective when they incorporate a human story. Introducing a human element adds context and makes it easier for the viewer to relate.\nIHop\u2019s \u201cAll You Can Eat Pancakes\u201d campaign included both a short-form and long-form video ad. The 6-second ad featured a single shot of the food itself, while the 15-second ad took advantage of those extra seconds by featuring three different people. No character is shown eating; we don\u2019t even get to see their faces. Yet the actors lend a human touch to the ad. Despite the age-old advice that every food ad needs a bite-and-smile moment, our analysis showed that a range of scenarios performed equally well, from ads that put chewing front-and-center to those in which no one actually ate.\nTry experimenting with varied ad lengths and creative executions to see what performs best with your brand and audiences.\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales lift, the memorability of your brand is as important as the food itself. And when it comes to brand expression, you should pull out all the stops.\nOur research shows that relying on a logo endcard might not be doing the most work for you. To make a lasting impression, think about seamlessly incorporating it throughout the ad, complemented by audio mentions, large type supers, and distinctive brand assets like mascots, brand colors, and mnemonics.\nThis Coca-Cola Vanilla ad does a great job of both subtly and not-so-subtly integrating the brand into all 20 seconds of video. The more your brand appears in the ad spot, the more likely viewers are to remember it.\nLastly, remember that the average viewer\u2019s brain can only retain so much information from any given ad. So when it comes to copy, our data supports using clear, accessible language.\nFor example, try describing the benefit rather than the ingredient. BelVita\u2019s breakfast biscuits are \u201cloaded with energy,\u201d while Special K\u2019s cereal is \u201cfeeding strength to power your moves.\u201d Special K takes the technique a step further by showing how the product helps active people, such as dancers, in their day-to-day lives.\nArmed with these five insights, your team can measurably increase creative effectiveness, making your products and your bottom line even more appetizing. Still, the best way to determine which creative practices support your goals, from awareness to conversion, is to experiment with your own ads and test them yourself."

        "output": "Today, people are spending more time online, and there\u2019s a growing challenge to hold their attention when they land on your site. When you do have their attention, it\u2019s even harder to capture their lead information. Landing pages aren\u2019t always the most popular sign-up forms, but they have the potential to accelerate your lead-generation efforts through effective design, copy, and prospect-acquisition strategy.\nWell-optimized website landing pages should convert prospects into leads. Think of it this way: Your website is like a storefront. A good landing page is a storefront window that welcomes customers by eliminating confusion and improving discoverability. Ultimately, it should convert prospective customers into solid leads.\nAt HubSpot, I\u2019ve worked with many brands over the years to optimize landing pages that deliver results. Here are four principles we use to increase lead generation.\nTo encourage the highest-quality results, landing pages should easily and quickly communicate the value of an offer \u2014 whether it\u2019s a guide, a set of templates, or a virtual event like a webinar. Be clear and avoid jargon. A well-built landing page should tell the audience what they should give in exchange for the content, how it will help solve their problem, and what exactly they\u2019ll get in return. The first impression that your customers will have of your company will come from your landing page, so it\u2019s important to think about your typical customers\u2019 fears and pain points. Be transparent by providing clear, comprehensive information up front \u2014 especially when it comes to factors such as additional fees, which may turn prospects away.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is worth a million. Adding compelling imagery and videos to landing pages helps grab attention and can help improve conversion rates. According to a HubSpot study on landing pages, 30% of top landing pages feature video content. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that imagery should be relevant and enhance the call to action (CTA), instead of driving added confusion.\nThe goal of a landing page is to have prospects hand over the desired information in exchange for the content or offer. Navigation of the page should be kept to a minimum and coupled with a clearly presented CTA to help customers quickly see the value in the page\u2019s offer and products. An action like \u201cDownload\u201d, \u201cSign up\u201d, or an otherwise relevant CTA at the top, middle, and bottom of the landing page can ratchet up more conversions because audiences don\u2019t have to go searching for the next step. Consider a personalized CTA, or smart CTA, which can convert 202% better than default versions.\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s marketing benchmarks report, companies see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. Successful landing page strategies have different pages to target specific audiences depending on where they clicked through from, and they keep each audience\u2019s motivators in mind through the entire page design. Improving relevance for your landing pages with different audiences can also lead to improved ad positioning \u2014 the better the experience your pages provide, the more likely your ads will show up in a higher position. One way to optimize your landing-page audience strategy is with Google Ads campaigns from Google and HubSpot. You can see how your leads perform by measuring key actions in the lead-to-sale journey, importing your offline conversions to understand the full value of the lead, and then using Customer Match to create personalized, meaningful landing page messages for different segments of those leads. Take the example of CallTrackingMetrics. The company synced its offline conversions to identify its most valuable leads and drove a 101% increase in marketing qualified leads.\nTo learn more about how you can help your small business succeed online, check out the new Google for Small Business digital essentials guide and the HubSpot and Google guide to Google Ads."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The marketing industry is entering a new golden age of opportunities, spurred by an unlikely catalyst: third-party cookies.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, industry leaders are making great strides to develop their \u201ccreative intelligence\u201d to reach and engage customers. Creative intelligence can be understood as the ability to customize creative without using third-party data, and then deliver these ads using the latest technologies to reach the right audiences, with the right messages, at the right times. The creative feel relevant and engaging, without the need for any personal data.\nAs we prepare for this new era in a so-called \u201ccookie-less world,\u201d here are three steps organizations can take now to build a privacy-safe creative strategy.\nMarketers must shift away from personalized ads toward a new, future-proof approach. The industry is on the cusp of a \u201ccontextual ads\u201d renaissance; these are ads that can be customized based on easily accessible information \u2014 like the date, time, weather, and even traffic conditions. This information is referred to as \u201ccontextual\u201d data, and it\u2019s been around for years but is often overlooked. These data points can play a huge role in helping marketers craft creative that is relevant and unobtrusive.\nContextual signals available to marketers\nBelgian windshield repair company Carglass recently used this privacy-forward approach to deliver customized video ads that drove impact. The firm delivered ads by using a combination of real-time data \u2014 including the weather and the streaming program a person was watching \u2014 along with first-party data about car ownership status. Contextual data about the user\u2019s country and language preference were also added into the mix. With all these data points, the company was able to serve individual viewers automated ads that were customized for the situation.\nFor example, a French speaker in Brussels watching a funny sitcom who had previously inquired about minor damage to their rear window would be served an upbeat advertisement in French, featuring rear windshield replacement and details about the Carglass service centers closest to them.\nThe ads led to an 89% drop in view-through conversion costs and drove bookings at a low cost per acquisition.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, marketers can adapt to this new creative context by drawing from a base of contextual signals, then adding in first-party data to segment audiences. Marketing teams can then go a step further by introducing statistical models to refine the clustering of audiences and predict future behavior. This allows teams to more effectively deliver relevant ads to the right audiences.\nCreative is sometimes a neglected area of marketing strategy, considered secondary to media buying and ad tech. However, Forrester research shows that shifting marketing budget from technology to creative resources can improve return on investment by up to 18%.\nTo tap into this growth potential, marketers will require both creative investment along with automation. Automated solutions can shuffle up creative assets to deliver highly relevant ads to potential customers, while saving teams precious time and energy.\nEuropean beauty retailer Douglas recently demonstrated how creative and automation can work together to deliver effective, customized ads. The company set up a campaign to reach website visitors who had provided their first-party data, and also included a wider audience of like-minded people by harnessing Google\u2019s Affinity Audiences. From there, Douglas used contextual signals to deliver ads to online pages their audiences were viewing, but they featured ads only on pages that included specific keywords.\nThe beauty of this campaign was that the company delivered these ads with automated, customized creative. People who were considered \u201chigh-potential\u201d and more likely to invest in premium products \u2014 based on first-party data and the pages they visited \u2014 were shown relevant ads for high-end beauty brands and products. Douglas aimed to improve the average order value of these loyal customers. Other audience members were shown ads aligned with their interests in either makeup, perfume, or skin care, and the featured products had lower prices. The creative assets and products were automatically swapped around to make the ads feel deeply relevant to customers.\nExample of makeup ad (left) and premium ad (right) from Douglas\nTwo animated ads for beauty products from Douglas cycle through images of a white woman modeling the nail polish, moisturizer, bronzer, blush, and anti-aging products featured.\nCreative workflows need updating in this new era. Teams need to move from a linear process to a continuous feedback loop.\nContinuous feedback loop\nThis creative workflow process involves creating dynamic ad templates where creative elements can be added and combined according to live signals, in real time. Then technologies such as Cloud Vision API can analyze visual elements and identify which approaches work best, for example, showing a person in an ad or simply showing the product. With some experimentation and testing, customer insights will build over time and new creative elements can be added into the mix and used in the ad templates. It\u2019s all about continuous, automated improvements to create the most relevant ads.\nA recent report from BCG outlines that a major airline took this approach and built a \u201cdynamic content factory.\u201d The team added between 20 to 40 new creative elements every week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, it had thousands of pieces of content to deploy using artificial intelligence into dynamic templates that combined email, web, and paid channels,\u201d said the BCG report authors.\nLuxury perfume and cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me used this approach as well, with ads built upon a dynamic template and creative assets that were automatically swapped around for improved audience appeal. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand used a continuous feedback loop to update the creative assets based on new customer insights, and these ads ultimately delivered a 31% higher click-through rate compared to static Lanc\u00f4me ads.\nThe dynamic creative were \u201ca great opportunity for our in-house programmatic team to generate actionable consumer insights,\u201d said L\u2019Or\u00e9al Germany\u2019s Head of Precision Marketing Nadine Kamski.\nThis shift toward new creative processes and away from third-party cookies could lead marketers to focus on new metrics to measure their success. While key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates are essential right now, other metrics could become more prevalent in the future. For example, engagement rates, brand lift, and return on investment could become the new standards to measure success.\nThe power of creative marketing is only set to increase, alongside the use of smart automation, as the marketing world transitions to a new privacy-first future.\n\u200b\u200b\u201dThere\u2019s so much to explore on our journey to using data creatively,\u201d says Di Mayze, global head of data at WPP. \u201cCurious data people will drive new kinds of innovation and creativity that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nWhen rethinking your brand\u2019s creative strategy, here are some points to consider."

The campaigns drove tens of thousands of people around the world to sign up as Global Citizens \u2013 a 220% increase on the average \u2013 resulting in one of Global Citizen\u2019s most successful digital acquisition campaigns, ever.Their journey uncovered 5 takeaways to get brands ready for what\u2019s next.\nTo get viewers to act, make action the center of the concept, versus relying on a call-to-action at the end. Protect the Planet leverages ASMR sound effects, visceral immediacy, and a CTA of \u201cStop this\u201d that progressively reveals throughout the ad to trigger viewer action, which resulted in strong click-through rates. Meanwhile, Advance Equity for All pairs an emotionally driven narrative with a YouTube best practice of breaking the fourth wall to deliver high average watch time and conversions per clickthrough.\nFrom striking visuals to emotional appeals, all campaigns experimented with making action integral to the storyline \u2013 driving record conversions for Global Citizen.\nSrinivas Seshadri, Director, Performance Marketing, Interactive Avenues India (End The Hunger Crisis)\nCombining YouTube and Google ad formats in an action-driving campaign can produce more efficient results than using one ad format alone. Each agency developed incredible action-driven Video action campaigns, but when paired with Discovery ads, the campaigns collectively resulted in 28% lower average conversion costs.Creating for multiple formats doesn't have to be complex. You can simply lift stills from your video asset and use them as images in Discovery ads alongside minimal copy and a succinct CTA. For all campaigns, agencies employed this approach to drive more efficient conversions.\nGeane Mota, Executive Director, Client Solutions, Blinks Essence (End Covid For All)\nGetting your audience\u2019s attention \u2014 and holding on to it \u2014 means you have more opportunity to educate, engage, or inspire. A more informed viewer is more likely to click and convert.\nAdvance Equity for All\u2019s impressive click-to-conversion ratio indicated that the longer audiences watched, the more likely they were to click through. So, grab the viewer's attention, then make sure you use it.\nWhether crafting awareness or action campaigns, the principles of YouTube's ABCD framework and Google Ads best practices remain vital. Attracting attention quickly, integrating brand throughout, and authentically connecting with audiences is essential, no matter the campaign. Once you have the attention of the viewer, be direct. Tell them what you want them to do, and show them how to do it. Campaigns with people-focused creative that address the viewer directly, like End Covid For All, perform well.\nAsking audiences to take action only works once they\u2019re already paying attention. So brands need to make sure they\u2019re making use of best practices in order to make that happen.\nChloe Stephenson, Creative Director, BBH London (Resume Learning)\nThe consumer journey is not linear, meaning that brands and agencies cannot operate in silos of creative and performance. To drive more effective and efficient campaigns, brands must break down these barriers.\nAll creative and performance agencies working on the Global Citizen campaigns partnered from the brief, through creative ideation to execution. Working collaboratively enabled campaign efficiencies and ensured all touchpoints across the customer journey were truly integrated.\nAbi Howson, VP, Video, Jellyfish UK (Resume Learning)\nWhether brands are trying to change the world or drive business results, direct response ad formats on YouTube and Google have the power to share stories that drive real action. Brands that harness the power of data-driven creativity won\u2019t only be ready for what\u2019s next \u2014 they\u2019ll be shaping what next looks like.\nWatch all the campaigns.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio.

        "output": "One of the best parts of working at YouTube is being part of the creator economy and enabling next-generation media companies to make the innovative content people love. Just last week, we announced that over the past three years, YouTube has paid $50 billion to fuel the creator economy. It\u2019s inspiring to see how these entrepreneurs are growing their audiences and businesses, while also experimenting with new tools and formats.\nTake Cassey Ho, for example. You might know her better as Blogilates, the world\u2019s most-watched Pilates instructor, who has made Pilates and wellness accessible to millions of people for more than a decade. During that time, she also became the CEO and lead designer of her own activewear company. And over the past year, she started using YouTube Shorts to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at her design process, and to share fitness tips, quick recipe ideas, and more. She does this all while continuing to post long-form workout videos daily.\nHo\u2019s willingness to innovate and embrace new formats in creative ways makes her beloved by millions. By adapting her content to be multiformat, she\u2019s also demonstrating a deep understanding of how viewers discover and watch videos today.\nThat\u2019s because people now move seamlessly between screens, experiencing worlds of content made of what they love, fueled by creators who are experts in what\u2019s relevant. In fact, streaming across different screens, video lengths, and creators is at an all-time high. Whether the content is long, short, mainstream, or personal, YouTube is the one place where people watch it all.\nHow can brands ensure that they are taking full advantage of a multiformat approach? Here are three key things to do.\nYou\u2019ve seen the dances. You\u2019ve heard the viral audio samples. And you\u2019ve probably been fooled by a \u201ccake or fake?\u201d clip at least once. If video is the breakout medium of the past few years, then mobile short-form vertical video is the breakout format. What\u2019s one thing all those short videos have in common? Creators who are constantly shaping and reacting to trends. Viewers can\u2019t get enough of them.\nSince its launch in 2021, YouTube Shorts is now home to 1.5 billion monthly active users and earns more than 30 billion daily views.1 While it\u2019s a mobile destination, Shorts also fuels discovery across formats and screens. Creators who upload both long-form video and Shorts on YouTube see longer overall watch time and subscriber growth. According to YouTube\u2019s latest Culture & Trends Report, 59% of Gen Z \u2014 the world\u2019s largest generation \u2014 agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nWhile viewers favor their mobile devices for short-form vertical video, they\u2019re increasingly turning to another familiar place for long-form online video from their favorite creators. In fact, TV is YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing screen today, with watch time continuing to level up. As of January 2022, on average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.3 The growing popularity of connected devices tells us that the old distinctions between network TV, digital, streaming, and mobile video are fading.\nSome of the shortest videos on YouTube last only a second or two, whereas the longest video on YouTube right now would take you about eight days to watch. Seriously. So what\u2019s the perfect length and type of content to keep viewers engaged?\nWe\u2019ve spent years studying and refining best practices for effective storytelling via short-form and long-form content on YouTube, exploring what makes content \u201cgood,\u201d and defining the ABCDs of effective YouTube creative. We also look to creators. Since the earliest days of video sharing on the internet, they\u2019ve experimented and optimized the length of their videos to find the sweet spot of audience attention. Because of this, they\u2019re a strong indicator of what works on YouTube.\nRight now, creators of all popularity levels are using short-form video as the latest space to experiment with new approaches and engage viewers. South Korean girl band Blackpink, for example, created the #PinkVenomChallenge on Shorts to promote the release of their latest music video, \u201cPink Venom.\u201d The group\u2019s multiformat marketing approach helped them set a new YouTube record: Pink Venom garnered 90.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the third-biggest 24-hour music video debut of all time.\nOther creators like fitness instructor GrowWithJo and dermatologist Dr. Dray have discovered that Shorts help them expand their existing YouTube channel audience and balance out their long-form content. GrowWithJo shares quick workout tips and tutorials on Shorts, inspiring viewers to also check out her long-form exercise videos. Meanwhile, Dr. Dray complements her in-depth skin care content with Shorts that offer bite-sized advice, such as quick answers to questions like \u201cWhat age to start retinoid?\u201d\nAnother way creators experiment is by giving their Shorts a distinctive style that stands out from other video formats. They might use built-in effects and filters, try different editing styles, or add popular audio samples. On top of this, they tend to use short-form video to capture content that\u2019s emotional in nature, whether delivering joy, high drama, or laughter.\nAll of this experimentation with short-form video makes creators an excellent resource for actionable Shorts-related tips. We often look to creators\u2019 learnings and insights when developing tools, templates, and creative best practices for making vertical video ads on YouTube. Here are some of our favorite creator tips for building successful Shorts.\nAs brands take inspiration from creators and experiment with short-form vertical video, they should keep in mind other creative considerations and the availability of automated tools and templates that make video ad creation easy.\nTo take advantage of this new evolution in content and user experience, marketers should think more expansively about their video campaigns and build for a range of ad lengths and screens. They can use this opportunity to break from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video ads by, instead, adapting creative assets to the look and vibe of the ad environment, whether it\u2019s in-depth, long-form video or casual, short vertical videos.\nThis combination of video ad formats is a recipe for success on YouTube. After all, adding vertical video to the mix gives brands a new creative canvas to tell their story and expand their multiformat strategy on YouTube, which helps drive the results they care about. Plus, Shorts can help brands show up alongside culturally relevant, creator-driven content that viewers love.\nMarketers should also use Shorts as a new way to achieve lower-funnel campaign goals. Because YouTube is a source of inspiration along the shopping journey, short-form video can easily help turn viewers into customers. And brands can now add vertical video assets to Video action, App, and Performance Max campaigns, which automatically scale to Shorts. Early testing shows that adding a vertical video asset to Video action campaigns delivers 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts compared to landscape videos alone.4\nCreators have been at the forefront of multiformat content experimentation, and have seen their YouTube presence and viewership grow exponentially as a result. Marketers can find similar success by studying how people move from screen to screen to watch different video formats, following creators\u2019 tips on how to engage audiences with Shorts, and using multiformat content to drive results across the entire funnel."

        "output": "Elizaveta Orekhovskaya and Artem Ryzhenkov, video advertising managers at global SaaS company Semrush, share the step-by-step plan behind their company\u2019s initiative to increase conversions with no additional budget.\nAt this stage of the pandemic, everyone is familiar with the laundry list of challenges faced by companies around the world: nervous customers, employee churn, supply-chain bottlenecks, and so on. Like the COVID-19 variants themselves, these challenges continue to take new forms with sometimes uncertain consequences.\nIn 2022, with many small- to mid-sized brands embracing digital advertising strategies for the first time, one key challenge is to break through the noise created by this shift in consumer behaviors and subsequent marketing activity.\nAt Semrush, where our business is to help brands manage their visibility on the internet, we faced this very problem as we set out to promote our own niche product with a complex funnel.\nOur customers use the Semrush platform to optimize search engine results and market more effectively online. Our platform simplifies content creation, social media, campaign creation, and competitive intelligence. Our primary goal with our most recent digital marketing initiative was to increase conversions with no additional budget. Here\u2019s how we did it.\nWe started out by investing in search and display traffic. Using keyword-based targeting, we identified an audience of users who were in-market for our product and began \u201cwarming up\u201d these potential customers with display visuals.\nThen we sought new media environments where we could drive performance without going over budget. We chose YouTube as one of these channels, given video\u2019s proven ability to create a story about a product. Our marketing team had tried YouTube before, but as we will see in a moment, its results left something to be desired.\nInitially, we set up our YouTube campaigns manually, rather than automating them. We did this mostly to understand the available optimization metrics. We launched a number of videos and analyzed them based on cost per impression, cost per view, cost per click, and click-through rate. With this knowledge in hand, our team began automating campaigns using performance metrics, such as cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate.\nThe next step was to develop a system for conversion and attribution tracking. Whereas we had previously attributed most ad conversions based on the click alone, we now added view-based attribution of YouTube ads using Google Campaign Manager.\nWith this change, YouTube\u2019s provable value as an ad channel \u2014 particularly at the customer attraction stage \u2014 was far more clear. And these placements assumed privilege of place among our other paid channels.\nOur team then tested every possible audience type, ad format, and bidding strategy. We found that custom audiences worked better for promoting a specific product than it did for a generic brand. In cases with frequently fluctuating budgets and long conversion funnels, a Maximize conversion bidding strategy proved more effective than a Target CPA strategy. And we settled on the skippable in-stream ad as the most effective ad format for its product.\nOnce the preliminary results were available, we set out to optimize our ad creatives and landing pages.\nOlga Denisova, our VP for digital marketing, observed that a better conversion rate at each stage is achieved by having videos of a certain duration, type of content, degree of complexity, and format \u2014 that is, animated or with human actors.\nFor example, at the upper stages of the funnel, we used short videos of up to 15 seconds that featured the product and encouraged trials. For lower-funnel marketing, we presented lengthier videos \u2014 up to a minute long \u2014 with more detail about a specific product feature or customer success story.\nBased on this insight, Denisova and her team began optimizing our video creatives according to the audience\u2019s phase of purchase consideration.\nOur earlier video creatives had basic graphics with lots of text but lacked voice-over and dynamism.\nWe corrected this in newer videos, focusing on more striking visuals with human actors. The CTA was also reworked for different stages of the funnel, and the video duration was optimized.\nOnce we had worked out our optimal YouTube ads settings, we set out to scale up the Semrush channel.\nBased on past experience, we introduced an optimal frequency of seven impressions per day and 10 views per month.\nFor remarketing campaigns, we based our learning strategy on the size of the targeted audience. In the upper remarketing funnel, with its large available audience of website visitors and registered users, we deployed Google\u2019s Maximize conversions bidding strategy. The lower stages of the funnel were optimized for cost per view, since the smaller available audience meant machine-learning strategies were less powerful.\nIt became clear over the course of this campaign that YouTube advertising not only delivered conversions directly, but also contributed to an increase in paid and organic search results. We saw interest in Semrush in the U.S. grow by an average of 72.6% during a Brand Lift study conducted in May 2021, while interest in our Keyword Magic Tool grew by 120.4%. Another video ad campaign in Canada delivered an increase in paid and organic Google search results of 521%.\nSince the pandemic restricted our ability to produce new video assets, we needed to improve our conversion metrics without increasing our budget or the number of video creatives we produced. To achieve this, our team used a new format from Google called Video Action campaigns, designed to drive lower funnel actions such as website clicks and conversions. As a result, the range of our ads expanded, their variability increased, and automated strategies began learning better from the increased number of conversions.\nIn Video Action campaign ads, we found the ideal palette for our new ad creatives. In one A/B test, a combination of skippable in-stream ads and Video Action campaign ads went up against skippable in-stream ads only. The combined strategy clearly performed better.\nOur CPA at the lowest stage of the funnel was 55% lower than that of the in-stream-only campaign. The cost per sign-up also fell 51%. Video Action campaigns cost 91% less, and view-through rates were 3% higher, than in-stream.\nAfter Video Action proved itself to be the superior strategy, not only on the basis of conversion but also in upper-funnel metrics, we launched the format in all automated strategy campaigns. This helped reduce the CPA per purchase from YouTube ads by a whopping 11%."

        "output": "The earliest known car ad told Scientific American readers that its product was a better investment than a horse. Today\u2019s auto brands face a crowded and competitive landscape, demanding more inventiveness. Producing an ad that really connects with the viewer can be a challenge. Creative is one tool you can leverage to make significant differences in ROI, and experimenting makes it easy to adapt and update campaigns at scale.\nTo find out what makes auto ads effective, our team analyzed thousands of auto ads on YouTube to better understand what drove performance. Based on our findings, we determined that these five creative strategies set the most successful ads apart.\nWhen it comes to the first few seconds of an auto ad, put the pedal to the metal. Opt for dropping viewers right into the action to hook their attention, over the more traditional wide running car footage they\u2019re used to seeing. From there, introduce dynamism with quickly paced, contrasting visuals paired with audio and supers.\nThe Cupra Born spot kicks off with a flash of a speeding car and keeps the momentum going by interspersing clips of the car with fleeting shots of engaging visuals to evoke the energy and excitement of being behind the wheel. The fast pace and rapid-fire stimuli grip the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them engaged throughout the ad.\nFacts and specs are important, but they\u2019re not the only things that work to sell a car. Anchoring your story in human experience allows your audience to imagine the tangible experience of the car, and how it might fit into their lives, building a personal, and more powerful, connection to your brand.\nMitsubishi Brazil\u2019s New Generation spot features women from all backgrounds literally and figuratively taking the wheel, including the wheel of a powerful new four-wheel drive. Multiple characters and a powerful storyline give viewers a reason to connect and emotionally invest.\nEngines revving, brakes squealing, tires hitting the ground: These familiar sounds create an immersive experience for viewers, an experience that becomes critical on YouTube, where 95% of ads are played with the sound on.1 Sound effects, voice-over, and other audio elements have been shown to engage people\u2019s attention and help them imagine what it\u2019s like to drive a particular car \u2014 an important consideration for purchase.\nMini USA\u2019s Hardtop 2-Door Hatchback spot amplifies the sound of the engine throughout the ad alongside everyday dialogue and a fun music track, bringing the full driving experience to life in an immersive and relatable way.\nEvery spot is a chance to show off the specs and features that make your car stand out from the rest, and simplicity is key. Ads shorter than 15 seconds are better served by focusing on one or two things, whereas longer ads have more wiggle room. The key is to keep it clear and not force too many messages at once. Have a lot to say? Consider experimenting by breaking up your multifeature spot with several shorter single-feature ads.\nFord US\u2019s F-150 campaign highlights two key features centered around one idea: making work accessible and easy, both inside and out, when you\u2019re on the road. The message is clear and simple, giving these standout features their chance to shine.\nMore than 70% of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices globally,2 so making your ad viewable on a 5-inch screen is a minimum requirement. Think bright, high-contrast colors, tight framing, and large-type supers to make your ad stand out on that small screen. \u201cBut will that translate to TV?\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve seen that mobile-first ads work just as well on connected TVs.3\nVolkswagen Canada uses bright colors and tight shots of their cars paired with large-type supers that add playful taglines to their fleet of SUVWs, ensuring that the ad is not only eye-catching, but memorable.\nUse these five data-backed creative strategies as a starting point for your next auto ad. Each tactic leaves plenty of room for your brand\u2019s unique sensibility. And once you have a strong foundation, try experimenting with different iterations of your creative to see what works best for your specific audience."

        "output": "Each year, the YouTube Works Awards program partners with Kantar to celebrate the most innovative and effective YouTube advertising in the industry. 2021 presented unique creative challenges as marketers faced the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, digital privacy concerns, and new privacy regulations. Undeterred, the brands with the six winning campaigns produced fresh, groundbreaking ideas that masterfully combined creative storytelling and YouTube. \u201cIn years past, there have been some category winners that were just brilliant video. When I look across this year\u2019s winners, everyone innovated and used the platform,\u201d said judge Colleen Leddy, chief engagement officer at Droga5.\nLet\u2019s look at four major takeaways from our winning campaigns and how they ingeniously used YouTube to drive impressive business results.\nBLK, a dating app for Gen Z and young millennials in the Black community, wanted its users to go from online connections to safe, real-life interactions. However, the COVID-19 health crisis still loomed and the COVID-19 vaccine remained a point of contention in the Black community. BLK decided to tap into Gen Z and young millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for streaming music to encourage its audience to get the vaccine. The brand launched a music video on YouTube called \u201cVax That Thang Up,\u201d which was inspired by a classic hip-hop song.\nThough the video stood at roughly two minutes in length and could be skipped, it still received over 3 billion media impressions in the first day. New registrations on the BLK app increased by 30% week over week, and first-time paid subscribers grew by 22% week over week. \u201cThey leveraged skippable and made you engaged enough to not want to skip,\u201d marveled one of our judges.\nIn contrast to BLK\u2019s longer content, travel metasearch site Kayak used quick, 15-seconds-or-less videos to address the effects of COVID-19 on travel. Using its own research and Google Trends, Kayak discovered that, even though many travel restrictions were still in place, Americans actually wanted to travel but needed the reassurance of more flexibility and options when booking trips. In response, Kayak created multiple campaigns that highlighted free cancellation and encouraged viewers to \u201cskip town\u201d instead of hitting the \u201cskip ad\u201d button.\nThe campaign proved a huge success, driving incremental conversion rates as high as 7.5% and raising purchase intent by 20%. John Deschner from Maximum Effort was impressed: \u201cThey helped you get over travel hesitancy in different ways and targeted people that were searching for these things.\u201d\nBlendJet, a blender company with a mission to make healthy food fast, easily appealed to women 24 to 54 years old, but knew it could reach a wider audience. For the launch of its new blender, the brand created a fun, out-of-the-ordinary campaign, which tapped into two wildly popular YouTube trends: \u201coddly satisfying videos\u201d and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). BlendJet\u2019s campaign, called \u201cOddly Satisfying ASMR Blends in a BlendJet 2 Portable Blender,\u201d featured a voice-over whispering clever statements while the blender hypnotically pulverized entire heads of cauliflower, chunks of ice, and more. To make sure this campaign would be seen by people most likely to buy its blenders, BlendJet focused on a custom intent audience segment, using its top converting keywords in Google Search.\nViewers ate it up. The video became a viral sensation that generated millions of dollars in sales. As a result, BlendJet\u2019s return on ad spend grew 569% year over year, and its revenue surpassed its initial target by 413%. Amanda Richman, CEO of Mindshare, praised BlendJet for turning a product demo into \u201csomething so different through the voice-over, the copy. They created content that is spot on for YouTube viewing.\u201d\nNew to the U.S. market, cat food brand Sheba needed an impactful campaign that would resonate with American cat parents. During its research, the brand discovered that cats often woke up their owners at unreasonable hours, like at four in the morning. Google Search data and YouTube analytics showed Sheba that roughly 1 in 3 people turned to their mobile phones during these moments. So Sheba created a soothing, five-hour video that used scientifically proven techniques to get people back to sleep. To promote the video during the day, Sheba released \u201csubliminal\u201d bumper ads. At night, it launched TrueView for action ads that were tailored to people\u2019s middle-of-the-night viewing habits on YouTube. A simple call to action in the ads would then lead tired cat parents to Sheba\u2019s sleep video.\nThe campaign resulted in a 100.9% uplift in brand recall and a 635% increase in searches for Sheba brand terms among those who had been exposed to the campaign. \u201cIt really was the best use of creative and media that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Traci Spiegelman, VP of global media at Mastercard. \u201cWhen you have a good insight, and find the right creative and media approach, you nail it.\u201d\nOnline dating app Tinder wanted to help the bisexual and bi+ community get more recognition and own the narrative around what it means to be bi+. It launched \u201cOnce Upon a Bi,\u201d a campaign that featured YouTube Creators reimagining well-known fairy tales based on the bi+ community\u2019s experience within the Tinder app. The brand then used TrueView for action to focus the campaign on affinity audience categories that overlapped with the creators\u2019 audiences.\nThe campaign received 3.2 million impressions, 2 million video views, and an average view rate that was 9% stronger than Tinder\u2019s previous campaign. \u201cTaking stories that have been passed on for generations and showing how they reinforce stereotypes, and using influencers and creators to tell the story was a really good use of YouTube,\u201d said Sheryl Goldstein, EVP, chief industry growth officer at IAB.\nDepartment store Target also partnered with a YouTube Creator to help diverse communities share their own stories. \u201cConvos with CEOs,\u201d a video series moderated by creator Hallease, centered on the entrepreneurial journeys of the Black-owned business founders whose products are in Target stores. Along with using paid media, Target promoted the campaign organically on YouTube by posting customer teaser content on its brand channel and publishing a playlist for the series.\nThe campaign garnered over 6.4 million views across all of the videos, over 107,000 hours of watch time, and over 20,000 total engagements on YouTube. \u201cThose convos were really rich and did the job that an ad could not have done,\u201d said Britt Nolan, president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett.\nIn a tough year, YouTube Works Awards winners turned hurdles into inspiration, reimagined content people already loved, appealed to their audiences 24/7, and gave the stage to diverse communities. They proved that a winning combination of clever storytelling and the YouTube platform can produce both viral sensations and enviable business results."

And, what do you know, instead of just buying a hair dryer, I bought the whole suite of products.\nFinding surprising products in a brick-and-mortar store is, or used to be, a common experience: that magical shopping moment when you stumble across something new that fits your needs perfectly. But this time, it happened in the world\u2019s biggest video storefront: YouTube.\nThe idea that e-commerce would evolve 10 years in six months started spreading during the pandemic. And while variations circulated around the industry, the concept is proving to be true: In 2020 alone, e-commerce grew nearly 30% worldwide.1\nThis summer, Publicis Groupe partnered with YouTube and Talk Shoppe to understand how the shopping journey has changed, and how brands can help enhance and expand people\u2019s experiences online. Here\u2019s what we found.\nSeventy-five percent of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration.2 This is because people have a shopping discovery mindset when they\u2019re watching video \u2014 and, of course, because there\u2019s so much content out there for them to discover.\nDue to the personalized experience of YouTube, they\u2019re not finding noise, but things that make their experiences and their lives better. For example, average daily uploads of videos with \u201cShop With Me\u201d in the title increased by over 60%, year over year.3\nYouTube is the matchmaker shoppers and brands have always wanted. You never know when a new shopping journey will begin. Importantly, this inspiration results in bigger shopping carts and upsells. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they can make a decision to purchase or not purchase faster.4\nCreators are the heart and soul of YouTube and the most tailored, personalized, shopping confidant someone could have. They are hybrids of a personal assistant and best friend, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.5\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 2021.\nWhen quality information is paired with authenticity, shoppers make confident decisions quicker, instead of leaving items in their cart while they weigh their options.\nMy daughter got me hooked on Emma Chamberlain. Twice, recently, we purchased something after watching her content. Social proof is powerful, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give them the best information about products and brands.6\nOf course, not everyone follows YouTube creators, but they can still find help on YouTube along their shopping journey. For these people, creator content is incredibly valuable, because the breadth, depth, and searchability means shoppers can find high-quality information. It\u2019s similar to reviews or star ratings on marketplaces. YouTube is a one-stop shop for the curious consumer.\nFor example, thrifting haul videos, a subset of the ever-popular haul format, in which creators share purchases that they\u2019ve made, have been viewed over 100 million times.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that YouTube\u2019s appeal as a shopping platform comes in exactly the place where brands can sometimes feel uncomfortable: It\u2019s all creator-driven, vast, and not always easy to wrap our minds around.\nResearch has repeatedly shown us that the quality of information matters more to shoppers than production quality. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they get the highest quality information about products.7\nWhen I think about these insights, I see opportunities everywhere: opportunities for brands to grow through partnering with creators; opportunities for platforms like YouTube to evolve and meet shopper needs; and opportunities to connect in new ways.\nOnline shopping is a whole new ballgame. And brands and advertisers need to adapt in this new world if they want to win big."

        "input": "",
        "output": "As marketers, we share a common goal: Convince people to engage with our brands. Truth be told, it can take a lot of work to make this happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always struck by YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard, an annual list of the most-watched video ads of the year. In a world of unlimited content, millions of people actually choose to watch these ads, so it\u2019s useful to consider what makes them so successful.\nWhile no single formula exists for a viral video ad, we can make observations about what works to inspire our own media strategies. Here are three proven approaches to try, pulled from the latest Ads Leaderboard.\nFor its \u201cHarry Potter\u201d 20th anniversary special, HBO Max wanted to reach two distinct audiences: die-hard \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans eager to be reintroduced to the magic of the series and a new generation of younger viewers who hadn\u2019t yet embraced the franchise.\nTo appeal to both groups, HBO Max leaned into a powerful trend: people like watching content that makes them feel nostalgic. With that trend in mind, the brand designed a video ad to give viewers a heartwarming, retrospective experience full of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d memories. Beyond showcasing the cast\u2019s memorable moments, the ad pulled in fans and authentically celebrated their journey too.\nHBO Max used YouTube to power the campaign. As JP Mallo, VP of marketing for HBO Max Originals, explains, \u201cYouTube is often our initial indicator when we release early marketing assets for how our audience is engaging, what sentiments we\u2019re seeing, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re responding to in terms of content themes.\u201d\nYouTube proved to be an ideal home for HBO Max\u2019s ads, since people of all ages gravitate to the platform for nostalgic content. According to a 2022 Ipsos survey, 80% of Gen Z reported watching YouTube to feel nostalgic;1 by running a nostalgia-based campaign on YouTube, HBO Max could appeal to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d enthusiasts, while also grabbing the attention of a younger generation.\nThe campaign launched mid-November with bumper ads, plus non-skippable and skippable in-stream ads to drive awareness and consideration. Then, in the days leading up to the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, HBO Max used YouTube Select to feature the ads alongside premium content. Finally, they concluded the campaign by leveraging YouTube Masthead before and after the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, placing the video on YouTube\u2019s home feed to drive mass awareness. In the end, the approach drove 12.7% awareness lift \u2014 remarkable for a brand with high awareness already \u2014 and reached 49 million unique users.\nWE, Egypt\u2019s primary telecommunications company, needed an ad campaign that could cut through the holiday noise during the busy Ramadan season. To achieve this, it strategized videos that would help viewers understand evolving trends of Ramadan.\nSince WE\u2019s message had to appeal to viewers across multiple generations, the team determined that \u201cthe campaign should include a diverse mix of ads,\u201d says Eslam Nassar, the brand\u2019s head of digital marketing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we turned to YouTube to tell a compelling, creative story across ad formats and screens.\u201d\nWE planned and executed a full-funnel video strategy that leveraged a unique blend of short- and long-form ads. For viewers in the awareness phase, the team launched 6-second bumper ads to tease the campaign and deliver a quick call to action.\nThen, to further engage middle- and lower-funnel audiences, WE created a full-length, in-stream video. This ad was designed to be watched across devices, from connected TV to mobile. To ensure that this long-form ad could fully immerse people in the brand\u2019s unique approach to storytelling, the team relied on YouTube\u2019s four guiding principles for effective video ads on the platform, the ABCDs \u2014 shorthand for attention, branding, connection and direction.\nTo quickly gain the attention of and connect with viewers, the video began with a catchy musical track. WE made sure the distinctive purple color of its logo dominated the video\u2019s visuals to reinforce company branding. To further connect with multigenerational viewers, the video compared and contrasted Ramadan traditions throughout the ages. Finally, the video directed people to take action by signing up for WE\u2019s services so they could stay in touch with family.\nThis multiformat strategy proved successful. Within the first 24 hours, the long-form video exceeded 1 million views. What\u2019s more, its completion rate surpassed the brand\u2019s 2021 Ramadan video by 204% as well as the market average for completion rate by 47%. Ultimately, the campaign reached 79% of Egypt\u2019s YouTube population.\nWE\u2019s digital advertising manager, Ahmed Nageb, concludes, \u201cYouTube is one of most important platforms to help us execute our digital strategies effectively. Because of its vast audience, which can be targeted through various ad formats and devices, we were able to achieve maximum reach, while hitting our campaign objectives.\u201d\nLast year, BMW launched its first ever fully electric BMW iX sports activity vehicle in the United States. To promote this milestone during the Super Bowl, BMW created a 60-second hero video ad that showed Zeus, the mythical Greek god of sky and thunder, retiring to Palm Springs and rediscovering his spark when gifted a BMW iX by his wife, Hera.\nTo extend the ad\u2019s reach during this tentpole moment, BMW made YouTube a core part of its Super Bowl strategy. \u201cYouTube is a great amplifier of content, which not only increased the audience size exponentially but extended the longevity of the spot,\u201d explains Albrecht Pagenstert, head of brand marketing at BMW. \u201cWhat ran once during the Super Bowl lives online and has received millions of additional views.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s strategy hinged on reaching a wide variety of passionate Super Bowl fans through YouTube AdBlitz, the premier hub for fans to watch Super Bowl ads with playlists for the most comedic, dramatic, action-packed, and inspirational spots. Through AdBlitz, BMW could target specific Super Bowl-related video inventory, such as NFL Highlights watched by sports lovers, and Big Game Music Lineups watched by audiophiles.\nOnce the campaign peaked viewers\u2019 interest during YouTube AdBlitz, BMW then strategized to satisfy their hunger for more content. It released behind-the-scenes videos, including interviews with the hero ad\u2019s star-studded cast and director.\nAudiences couldn\u2019t get enough of BMW\u2019s campaign. In fact, many YouTube commenters enthusiastically asked for the hero video to be turned into a full movie. In the end, the video drove 17 million unique views and 970,000 clicks. In addition to being recognized on YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard in the U.S., BMW earned the No. 7 spot in USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter.\nHBO Max, WE, and BMW struck gold with video ads that entertained and engaged key audiences. By aligning their ads with popular YouTube trends, building bespoke creative for different platforms, and following the ABCDs of video effectiveness, these brands showed how to successfully combine immersive storytelling with the power of YouTube."

        "input": "",
        "output": "It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in the middle of a digital video boom, as alternatives to linear TV grow at unprecedented rates. According to Nielsen\u2019s total TV and streaming report, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time.1 And viewers watch a daily average of over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV devices.2\nSource: YouTube Internal Data, Global, Jan. 2022.\nThis level of engagement informs how viewers feel about ads. In a new study, we found that viewers agree that YouTube ads on the TV screen are more relevant (59%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3 Connected TV gives advertisers a powerful creative canvas to reach viewers when they are highly engaged, streaming their favorite content on the living room screen.\nTo better understand the opportunity for advertisers, these three brands ran experiments to see how effective CTV could be for their audiences. Here are the questions they set out to answer.\nOn behalf of its Ruffles brand, Frito-Lay North America leveraged CTV to engage with some of its core audiences, such as younger families, flavor variety seekers, millennials, and those living in urban areas. The marketing team wanted to understand how increases in watch time on CTV contributed to brand and sales goals.\nIn 2021, Ruffles ran an A/B test with half the media budget delivered across devices as usual and the other half with an increased allocation to CTV. It then compared performance to delivery.\nThe result? \u201cThe higher delivery to the increased CTV cells exceeded our expectations and benchmarks across view rates, ad recall, and sales lift,\u201d said Amanda Corral, senior director of paid media strategy at Frito-Lay North America. \u201cAnd we achieved this without sacrificing CPM or reach. We were thrilled to deliver a strong impact while maintaining efficiency and delivering higher ROI.\u201d\nL\u2019Oreal USA has built its brands with a commitment to consumer-centricity. Across its brands, that has meant committing to cut-through creative. (Think, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re born with it, maybe it\u2019s \u2026 .\u201d You know the rest.) It has also meant constantly refining media and audience strategies that evolve as the brands\u2019 customers do. For the past several years, L\u2019Oreal USA has followed the lead of its customers and ramped up investment in YouTube.\nThe company has honed a tried-and-true approach to creative and reach, and wanted to see how that approach scaled to CTV. So in the summer of 2021, when it was time to lean into upper-format, demand-generating media, L\u2019Oreal USA increased its YouTube investment by 102% year over year. \u201cWhat was interesting about this time was, we were seeing audience behavior patterns around ad-supported streaming and a boom in CTV that we knew wasn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d said Shenan Reed, SVP, head of media at L\u2019Oreal USA.\nThe company ran a meta-analysis across nearly 30 NCS sales lift studies and found that its YouTube activity delivered an average of 6% sales lift for its campaigns. The company also saw a 6 to 1 return on ad spend on YouTube CTV screens. Not only did this prove that L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s creative and audience strategies can scale to CTV, but it also saw that the majority of impact was coming from new consumers. That\u2019s important because, coming out of the pandemic, the team knew the company needed to attract the next generation of new consumers and first-time buyers.\n\u201cOur consumer is still in the living room, but they\u2019re watching a wider variety of content \u2014 content that is more personal, that\u2019s more of the moment. You can ignore that behavior, or you can choose to show up. And we chose to show up,\u201d said Reed.\nDocuSign was initially apprehensive about CTV, since users aren\u2019t able to click through and convert on the TV screen. However, the brand put aside those reservations and decided to experiment by using the channel to increase reach and brand awareness. DocuSign understood the importance of reaching its users wherever they were, including their connected TVs.\n\u201cBefore this test, we didn\u2019t know there was such a large audience on CTV that we weren\u2019t reaching through other video ads,\u201d said Andy Tack, senior marketing manager at DocuSign.\nBy running a CTV-dedicated advertising campaign alongside a regular cross-device campaign, DocuSign was able to isolate and quantify the impact CTV had on its campaigns. The marketing team found that the CTV ads drove a best-in-class 33% relative lift in ad recall. Furthermore, despite worries about barriers to action, DocuSign actually saw a 126% relative conversion lift for its trial sign-ups.\n\u201cWe can now clearly see the value CTV has in our campaigns,\u201d said Tack. \u201cWhether we\u2019re growing brand awareness and recall, or improving consideration and purchase intent, CTV is a critical part of our approach.\u201d\nNo model exists for the perfect CTV advertising strategy. Whether planning media on behalf of a CPG company, reaching new cosmetics buyers, or taking a chance on a new channel, brands of all types are showing what can be done. The one thing they have in common is that their efforts were rewarded."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s uncertain economy, video marketers may find it difficult to keep calm and carry on. For most, measuring the effectiveness of their media investments will be a top priority. And while focusing on measurement can help marketers fuel both short-term and long-term growth, not all measurement approaches are created equal. Success depends on having the right media strategies and tools.\nIt may be tempting, for instance, to concentrate only on immediate results during disruptive times. But savvy marketers will combine their short-term and long-term business goals and take a more holistic full-funnel approach to YouTube. Indeed, recent research by Nielsen shows that brands that added upper-funnel marketing efforts to existing mid-funnel campaigns were able to boost return on investment (ROI) by 70%. And brands that added upper-funnel tactics to campaigns that covered the middle and lower funnels were able to raise ROI by 13%.\nProving the value of a full-funnel video strategy requires using measurement tools and tactics that leverage how upper-funnel brand goals and lower-funnel performance objectives play off each other. To do this successfully, marketers can use an effective three-part framework that balances tried-and-new methods with newly emerging measurement practices. Two parts of the framework \u2014 attribution and incrementality \u2014 help set you up for short-term business outcomes, while the third part \u2014 marketing mix modeling \u2014 can help you make smarter decisions for the long haul.\nHere is a deeper look at how to apply the framework.\nThese days, using an attribution model that assigns credit for conversions to different ads that occur across the customer journey should be standard practice. When it\u2019s done right, attribution can help marketers easily optimize their ad strategies. Google\u2019s data-driven attribution model can help you analyze your customers\u2019 journey across Search, YouTube, and Display to discover which touchpoints are most effective.\nWhile attribution can help you uncover and optimize for opportunities quickly, it\u2019s important not to treat it as a stand-alone measurement solution. Relying only on attribution insights to optimize your plans may provide quick growth, but it will come at the risk of not investing in the upper-funnel branding strategies that constantly refuel the pool of customer demand. Additionally, as measurement becomes more challenging in a privacy-first world, having multiple sources of truth instead of relying solely on attribution will be critical. To take attribution to the next level, pair it with incrementality.\nOne powerful way to supplement attribution and take your measurement mix to the next level is to include incrementality. Generally defined as a lift or increase in a desired outcome, incrementality helps you understand the KPI uplift due to your ad. As a result, incrementality can help you better understand the impact of full-funnel campaigns and pave the way for longer term growth.\nThe primary way to measure incrementality is to measure the performance of your full-funnel video strategy using various lift metrics. Google offers an array of solutions to measure lift across the customer journey, including Brand Lift , Search Lift, and Conversion Lift. When combined into one unified view of measurement, Google uses these metrics to showcase the value and impact of YouTube full-funnel campaigns that span all marketing objectives to help you understand the effectiveness of each.\nIncrementality should never be treated as a one-off exercise, regardless of the outcome. Embracing a test-and-learn mindset will better position brands for resilience and long-term growth. Harvard Business Review found that marketers who run multiple tests see up to 30% higher ad performance. Once you have results in hand, optimize your media accordingly. Keep in mind that it\u2019s critical to continue gathering insights and refining your strategy beyond your initial tests. Building experimentation into your overall measurement plan will help ensure that you are consistently optimizing and refining over time.\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is a tried-and-true, privacy-durable way to measure the impact of all YouTube formats across the funnel. It is also an effective way to capture both the short- and long-term impact of marketing investments. Using longitudinal online and offline data, MMMs provide you with the ROI for each media channel. Not only should these studies be used to show how media channels performed in the past, they should be used to optimize your media allocations moving forward.\nResults from MMM studies take into account a combination of variables, so it\u2019s critical to break out YouTube from other video platforms where possible. A Nielsen study found that the return on ad spend from marketing mix models varied by as much as 48% when video platforms were individualized versus when they were aggregated together. And format-level insights provide the most actionable level of granularity, especially when it comes to a full-funnel mix. Inputs matter when it comes to your model.\nEconomic uncertainty can rattle even the most confident marketer. But adopting a full-funnel video media strategy and balancing complementary short-term and long-term measurement practices can help fuel long-term business growth. To ensure the value and effectiveness of your full-funnel strategy, marketers should leverage attribution, incrementality, continuous experimentation, and MMM to drive short-term performance and reach your overarching branding goals."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marie Gulin-Merle, global VP of ads marketing at Google, speaks at a round-table discussion about the AI revolution during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about a meeting I had more than a decade ago, when digital marketing was at the beginning of its mobile revolution. A consulting company was advising me to embrace \u201creal-time\u201d marketing. I was intrigued, but didn\u2019t think it was attainable given the state of the technology we had at that time.\nI was spending my days in the trenches with my teams and agencies. We wrestled with how to create assets across an ever-multiplying set of formats. We scrambled to keep up with trends that would ignite like wildfire, only to dissipate just as quickly. We were manually piecing together the right media mix and trying to figure out how to spend budgets in a way that delivered ROI.\nMore than anything, I dreamed of being able to get out of the weeds of digital execution to focus my attention on our customer connections, the quality of our storytelling, and our business outcomes. I just wanted to get back to marketing. But, at the time, that felt like science fiction.\nNot anymore.\nWe\u2019re all already using AI to reach our customers more efficiently. In fact, 80% of Google\u2019s customers are already using AI-powered Search ads products. Now with generative AI, marketers have a rapidly expanding set of AI-powered tools with the potential to revolutionize every single part of marketing \u2014 from how we mine for insights, brainstorm ideas, and generate content to how we connect with people, drive growth, and measure performance.\nWhen it comes to content, my biggest pain point as a marketer is simple. There are never enough people to keep up with the velocity, volume, and variations required to reach people when and where I need to.\nNow, with new AI-powered tools, my team can scale the creative concepts we love to more formats with unprecedented precision. This means more time and attention can be devoted to shaping core creative concepts. AI can then draw from this source material to instantaneously generate assets like social copy, landing pages, and emails.\nAI can do the same for ads, with alternate ad copy, automatically formatted videos, and multiple combinations of product photos, all leading to infinite permutations of tailored ads for every customer.\nAt Google we\u2019ve been using AI in our ad products since 2015. And we\u2019re already allocating a significant amount of our media spend toward AI-generated creative across Display, Video, and Search, because it has proved to be effective. There are three core areas we\u2019re focused on.\nCreative testing: Google Cloud technology is helping us use AI to score creative, predicting success or failure, before we put it out into the world. In ongoing pilots, we\u2019re using AI to help us weed out poor performers more quickly and to more easily identify potential winners. We\u2019re also working with an agency partner to apply AI to our creative asset library. That way we can understand what has performed well historically and use that knowledge to develop future campaigns.\nCampaign optimization: Our marketing teams do all of their on-stack optimization with AI. Our teams are using AI to identify the best mix of formats and placements to meet our goals across screens and audiences. Although people\u2019s behaviors are complex, reaching them across multiple surfaces \u2014 YouTube, Search, Gmail, Maps, Shopping, and Discover \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be. For example, Performance Max, our AI-powered campaign type, is driving an 18% uplift in conversions at a similar cost per action.1\nMeasurement: In response to people\u2019s increasing expectations for digital privacy, regulators and tech platforms are restricting techniques that advertisers have relied on for decades to reach audiences and measure results, such as device IDs and third-party cookies. We\u2019ve all long relied on huge stores of data to drive performance and measurement. AI is helping us use fewer signals, while driving the intelligence and trusted measurement we need.\nStill, it will take more than a culture of experimentation to capture AI\u2019s full potential. We are making sure we learn and then scale. Only then can we develop a deeper understanding of how and when AI can be deployed to augment and amplify human skills. To make this all as easy as possible to navigate, my team put together a list of AI Essentials that you can use to make sure you have the right AI foundation.\nAs we embark on this journey, what gives us confidence is Google\u2019s bold and responsible approach. AI has incredible potential to benefit our industry, but it is not without risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be responsible from the start. As an example, to address misinformation, Google will soon be integrating new innovations like \u201cabout this image\u201d metadata in Search and image watermarking. We are also using AI to deliver a privacy-first ads experience that drives results for performance marketers while also protecting consumers\u2019 privacy.\nIt\u2019s such an exciting time. The tools and capabilities I could only dream about in my days as a CMO in consumer packaged goods and retail are here \u2014 now. Marketing is about connecting brands and products to people. The \u201cwhat\u201d remains the same. The \u201chow\u201d is changing again. Marketers, we can finally get back to marketing.\nOur marketing teams here at Google have been experimenting with AI tools to be more productive and creative. Take a look."

        "output": "Marketers are told time and again to factor return on investment (ROI) into their media planning decisions, but putting this into practice can be daunting. It doesn\u2019t help that the media landscape is more fragmented than ever, making it difficult to isolate the impact of any given ad placement, let alone optimize for it.\nAt Google, we work closely with clients to improve media measurement and have come to recognize marketing mix models (MMMs) as the most comprehensive way of understanding ROI measurement across different media channels, spanning online and offline.\nAnalyzing a range of advertiser MMM results over the years has also helped us identify the key contributors to ROI growth for YouTube in particular. Our research shows that there are four primary levers of video ROI: creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience.\nOf course, optimizing each of these levers can look quite different from one advertiser to the next. Every marketer should experiment to understand what works best. Doing so will help them confidently make decisions around their campaigns, resulting not only in better ads but better returns.\nTo understand how each of these work, let\u2019s walk through the stories of four brands that discovered firsthand how these levers increased their ROI.\nResearch has shown that effective creative accounts for almost 50% of ROI.1 Google analysts and researchers have studied thousands of ads to understand what specific elements drive performance on YouTube. We call these elements the ABCD principles: attention, branding, connection, and direction. According to research conducted by Nielsen, ads following the ABCD principles saw a 30% higher sales lift than ads that didn\u2019t adhere to them.2 Google sales teams are equipped to help brands analyze and optimize their creative for YouTube to drive greater business impact.\nShapermint, a global e-commerce brand, wanted to both boost its brand and drive product sales. Over the course of seven weeks, it ran experiments to understand what combination of creative drove the best results in its YouTube ad campaigns. By alternating among user testimonials, product demos, and a special offer, each video had its own unique angle. Shapermint tested the impact of its messaging along with other creative levers, such as length and pacing. As a result, the brand found its optimal combination of creative, assembling a powerful mix that lowered its cost per acquisition (CPA) by 21% and drove 50% more purchases.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start by building out the foundation of your video creative according to the ABCDs, and then try experimenting with various creative elements to see what works best for your audience.\nDifferent YouTube formats serve different objectives, but research shows that full-funnel strategies consistently deliver higher ROI. Brands that combine both awareness and action YouTube ad formats as part of a full-funnel strategy see higher ROI than when using either one in isolation. Based on a custom Nielsen meta-analysis, a full-funnel YouTube strategy drives 10% higher ROI compared to awareness advertising alone.3\nSulwhasoo is a South Korean luxury skin care brand from Amorepacific. Having surpassed $790 million (1 trillion KRW) in annual sales, it is quite well known. However, it wanted to try leveraging YouTube ads to drive more conversions beyond the awareness campaigns it had historically relied on. For this experimental campaign, Sulwhasoo first used a foundation of awareness and consideration formats to maximize its audience reach. Then it layered in action formats for the first time, turning attention into action. With this YouTube full-funnel strategy, the brand saw a staggering 91% decrease in CPA and a 13.8X increase in conversion rate.\nWhile it might seem intuitive to primarily buy action formats in the pursuit of tangible ROI, advertisers will see higher returns by adding awareness formats. In fact, a recent study shows that YouTube advertisers see Awareness formats driving 28% of their conversion assists.4\nThough reach and frequency are closely knit, each impacts ROI quite differently. All else being equal, increasing reach usually maintains ROI, while increasing frequency past a specific point usually diminishes ad effectiveness. For many advertisers, this well-known rule of thumb can make them fearful of increasing their frequencies. However, most advertisers overindex on cautiousness, and, in reality, have more breathing room to increase frequency on YouTube than they might think. On average, brands can increase average weekly frequency on YouTube from one to three ad exposures without diminishing YouTube ad effectiveness, according to an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen.5\nTo simplify the process, we\u2019ve recently started letting advertisers using Video reach campaigns choose a frequency target of up to five impressions per week, helping them to achieve maximum reach while setting a desired weekly frequency. This leads to a more efficient spend and a better experience for viewers. And we\u2019re piloting YouTube reach and frequency data availability through our MMM data platform to help advertisers understand their measurements better.\nFor example, after including reach and frequency data in its commercial mix modeling program with Analytic Partners, Peloton discovered that its ideal optimization strategy was more nuanced than it had expected. The results showed that there was an opportunity to drive incremental reach after optimizing frequency, leading to a potential ROI improvement of 15%.\nLast but not least, who you show your ads to significantly affects your ROI. Every brand has at least one demographic audience, but adding in audiences based on interests and behaviors can help you reach more potential customers. For example, a beauty brand might want to show its ads to viewers who are watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or a pet food company could choose to show its ads to those who recently searched for \u201cbest organic dog foods.\u201d These nuances can make all the difference in final purchase decisions.\nThe Insights Finder tool helps marketers uncover actionable audience insights related to interests, demographics, and more, using aggregated and anonymized signals from Google and YouTube. These insights allow brands to add new audience segments and to see how their ROI is affected. Oreo used Insights Finder to break down their audience into four segments: Entertainment Fans, Trendsetters, Gamers, and Foodies. The brand created personalized creative for each of these segments and saw an impressive 100% year-over-year improvement in YouTube ROI.\nBy focusing on creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience, advertisers can better understand the contributors to their ROI. Google teams can help brands that are on this journey figure out how to optimize each of these four levers. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen, YouTube return on ad spend grew by 108%, on average, for brands after collaborating with Google, an increase that was 7X greater than seen by brands that did not collaborate with Google.6 Close partnership with our media customers is absolutely key to capturing the power of media mix modeling."

        "input": "",
        "output": "From brushing our teeth in the morning to cleaning the kitchen counter after dinner, home and personal care (HPC) products are an essential part of our daily routines. Because these items are ubiquitous, finding imaginative ways to market them can sometimes be a challenge.\nWe know, however, that when it comes to designing ads to break through the clutter, creative has proved to be a particularly powerful tool for advertisers. Our team analyzed thousands of global HPC ads to understand exactly what kind of creative choices make some of these ads more effective than others. What we found pointed us to five creative insights about what resonates with viewers when it comes to HPC ads.\nResearch and development is how brands differentiate themselves. And while R&D is critically important, how brands communicate those differentiators is just as significant. Rather than using complex terminology (whether it\u2019s a little known ingredient or a reference to a scientific process), help people by simplifying the language or concept into a language they can easily understand.\nFor example, instead of describing technicalities, Liquid Plumr shows its benefits through a straightforward test: a universally relatable experience of a sink clogged by the oatmeal and cucumber chunks from a home-spa mask. The ad lets the viewer see the product\u2019s capabilities rather than explaining it, as one pour of Liquid Plumr clears away the clog in a single satisfying visual.\nRather than trying to hit the entire marketing funnel with a single ad, consider the creative choices that accurately address a specific objective. What works to effectively drive short-term sales goals looks quite different from ads that are focused on long-term brand equity. Ads focused on brand building can often benefit from a longer, more creative story, whereas ads focused on short-term sales and performance work the hardest when the focus is on the product itself.1\nWith the release of their new vacuum cleaner model, Bosch Hausger\u00e4te (Domestic Appliances) created a 20-second spot showing the product in action and focusing on one key feature, an approach that proved to be effective in driving short-term sales. However, when it came to creating their brand campaign, Bosch took a very different creative path. The minute-long spot featured a cast of several characters, each with distinct storylines tied together by the campaign slogan #LikeABosch, showing all the ways Bosch can play a role in our everyday lives.\nPersonal care products are just that: personal. People want to see that the product can fit into their everyday lifestyle, and being seen in that process is important. To reach all of your consumers, consider who you\u2019re portraying in your campaigns. More inclusive representation across ethnicities, ages, and genders can drive greater engagement and help your consumers connect with your brand proposition. In fact, representation is the No. 1 driver for ad recall for HPC ads, proving that integrating diversity into your ads can leave a lasting impression.2\nAll Good, a diaper brand focused on sustainability and clean ingredients, made sure to speak to all parents with its campaign. Recognizing that all kinds of families exist \u2014 whether interracial, young, single-parent \u2014 it acknowledges that many parenting struggles are universal no matter who you are. This allows viewers to connect with the brand in a more authentic, genuine way, simply by being seen and heard.\nPeople don\u2019t always have a strong emotional connection to products, especially when it comes to everyday things in home and personal care. Building that connection is vital to engagement and can help a brand stand out. Having a creative, evocative storyline that goes beyond the product can go a long way in capturing a viewer\u2019s attention.\nVeet France\u2019s \u201cYour hair, your choice, our products\u201d campaign walks through a number of poignant vignettes of various women: with a lover in bed, at a lively summertime party, laying in the grass, and admiring their arm hair. By showing a range of body types and body hair, it tells a story of the many different ways one can be a woman. A single overlying narration directly addressing the audience helps send a message about everyone being entitled to their own opinions on their bodies and body hair. Though its products are touted as a way of helping people do whatever they want with their hair, the story goes far beyond the product line.\nPeople usually don\u2019t think about what personal care products sound like, but the use of audio can evoke memories, help us more easily contextualize something, or amplify messaging. Audio is an underutilized resource in video ads despite it being one of the most effective ways to drive lift across brand metrics. Use it to amplify any visual element, like brand names or supers. Audio can also be used for product usage cues, like the spray of a bottle or the splash of a product pour.\nDowny Korea promoted its Puff laundry detergent with a short but evocative spot. When the character squeezes the puff, a sound effect emphasizes the satisfying, squishy texture, allowing the viewer to imagine what it feels like without being able to touch the product. Then, as the puff hits the laundry water, it bursts with an explosive sound. The dramatic, powerful sound communicates how vigorous its cleaning capabilities are.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why these five data-backed tactics can benefit the creative for your next HPC ad. They\u2019ll serve as a starting point for building a strong foundation as you apply your own creative angles that are true to your brand. And to really maximize your ads\u2019 effectiveness, remember to continually experiment with your creative to understand what truly drives the best results for your brand and audience."

        "input": "",
        "output": "At YouTube, we\u2019ve analyzed the content and creators that broke through in 2022 to uncover the global insights and themes we believe will help define consumer trends in 2023. Based on what we found, we\u2019ve identified three ways marketers can take inspiration from successful creators to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with their audiences.\nThe most successful marketing shows an understanding of what motivates an audience to engage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to value online communities and understand how they can amplify and strengthen your messages.\nCreators excel at this. The top YouTube content of 2022 demonstrates how creators can inspire active engagement from their communities through moments that capture public attention. In the U.K., for example, British YouTubers Sidemen brought together audiences from many top creators to raise over $1 million during their charity football match. Meanwhile, in the U.S., American creator MrBeast made YouTube\u2019s 2022 year-end list for top 10 creators with a Willy Wonka-themed challenge video, featuring contestants from his fan base. And in Germany, the continued success of collaboration duo 7 vs. Wild can be partly attributed to their viewers, who share their takes in scores of reaction videos.\nAcross moments and geographies, viewers are forging connections with communities online that they may not interact with elsewhere. Indeed, 55% of Gen Z agree that they watch content that no one they know personally is interested in.1\nThe takeaway for marketers? Find ways to encourage participation from online groups who have specific personal interests and lean into them. By doing so, you can create brand moments with greater impact and meaning.\nIn 2022, audience interest spanned multiple formats and content categories, and their preferences often changed based on their mindset and the moment. While this trend may seem like an obstacle, it presents a great opportunity for marketers to follow the lead of creators who successfully reach new audiences by meeting them where they are.\nIn the past year, creators who told stories across multiple formats had the fastest growing audiences. For instance, Indonesian swimmer Timotius Mulyadi, whose long-form videos usually clock in at over eight minutes long, experimented with 60-second swimming tutorials, which made him one of his country\u2019s breakout creators last year.\nFact is, engaging audiences successfully in one format often means that viewers will follow you from screen to screen. Our research shows that 59% of Gen Z agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nShakira successfully capitalized on this behavior when she promoted the release of her latest song with Rauw Alejandro, \u201cTe Felecito.\u201d Instead of simply launching the music video, she used a series of Shorts to excite fans and encourage them to watch the full video experience. First, she sparked curiosity by inserting teasers from her new video into the YouTube thumbnails of her all-time classic videos. Then she released a preview of her new video on YouTube Shorts. Finally, she launched a group of Shorts that taught viewers how to do the video\u2019s choreography, which sparked a new dance challenge. This creative use of multiformat content helped her music video become the sixth most-watched in Mexico in 2022 according to YouTube Music trends.\nMeeting your audience where they are also means speaking their language, sometimes quite literally. MrBeast showed up on top creator lists in Brazil and France by using dubbed language channels. Meanwhile, Brazilian creator Jooj Natu\u2019s English-language channel helped him extend his reach into the U.S. and Canada.\nWhile marketers can take inspiration from the multiformat success of these creators, they can also engage with new audiences in a very simple and attainable way. According to a Google study, adding a vertical creative asset to a Video action campaign delivered 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts than using landscape assets alone.3\nIn the past, viral short-form videos often resulted from accidental, random moments captured on camera. But these days, Shorts are less off-the-cuff, and more crafted and intentional.\nThe Shorts that attract the largest audiences have been specifically designed to recreate the spontaneous feel of those older videos, with deliberate moments of surprise and delight. For creative inspiration, marketers can look to circus acrobat Jake Hinga, who found Shorts success by capturing him and his friends undertaking elaborate trampoline challenges. Alternatively, they can see how Chris Ivan, the king of toilet plunger trick shots, reached 80 million views by collaborating with restaurant business, Dave & Busters.\nBut Shorts don\u2019t need to seem spontaneous to be successful. Last year, comedy creators attracted audiences with character-driven sketches and parodies. Take Germany\u2019s Anna Strigl, who encouraged environmental activism in one of the country\u2019s most viewed Shorts of the year.\nThe most important takeaway for marketers is that the best short-form videos embrace the format\u2019s strength and encourage people to watch them again and again. What does this mean exactly? According to our list of top creator tips, one major thing marketers need to do is give their Shorts an immediate hook. As The Korean Vegan, a U.S.-based cooking creator, says, \u201cThe first one to two seconds are the most important. That hook better be visually, audibly, and intellectually irresistible.\u201d\nLeveraging communities, meeting audiences where they are, and creating innovative Shorts aren\u2019t just YouTube strategies. Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the way audience expectations are evolving. Marketers who incorporate these actions into their creative will empower themselves to successfully connect with the right audiences at the right moments in 2023 and beyond."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you\u2019ve watched YouTube throughout the years, you know it\u2019s evolved quite a bit. Long gone are the days when the content exclusively centered on off-the-cuff vlogs. Now, YouTube is a place that millions go to witness major cultural events. But even beyond that, people are turning to YouTube to experience the moments around these moments.\nTake me, for example. I recently watched Silk Sonic\u2019s 64th Grammy Awards performance on YouTube. Then I found myself watching video after video of related content, like Kyle Hanagami\u2019s choreography to a Silk Sonic song. I went from enjoying one performance at a major event to digging deeper into the culture surrounding that performance.\nThis type of watch behavior is ubiquitous on YouTube, and it gives brands the unique opportunity to make advertising budgets go further and work harder. Recent campaigns from Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z International are proof of this. Here\u2019s how each company successfully used YouTube to stand out, extend its reach, and increase brand awareness during a key tentpole moment.\nLast year, Hyundai planned to debut its new electric vehicle (EV), the Ioniq 5, during the Super Bowl. Angela Zepeda, Hyundai\u2019s CMO, says, \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center.\u201d\nWith more people watching live sports online, Hyundai wisely opted for a multimedia campaign. It aired a TV spot during both the NFL\u2019s AFC and NFC Championship games and again during the Super Bowl pregame show. However, in contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai went digital-first during the Super Bowl.\nAs Zepeda explains, \u201cWe know that digital-first audiences care deeply about keeping their pulse on the cultural zeitgeist, but are less likely to have standard cable and more likely to be cord-cutters. That\u2019s where YouTube came in.\u201d After consulting a Nielsen study showing YouTube as the leader in streaming watch time in the U.S., Hyundai felt confident that the platform would put them front and center with its audience.\nCore to Hyundai\u2019s digital-first approach was investing in YouTube AdBlitz inventory and surrounding its ads with Super Bowl-related content. This included videos directly related to the big game, such as NFL highlight footage, along with content tangentially related to the Super Bowl, like recipes and cooking demonstrations geared toward foodies and tailgaters. By doing so, Hyundai extended its reach beyond the mainstream Super Bowl culture and tapped into the event\u2019s subcultures.\nTiming was also integral to Hyundai\u2019s approach. The company extended its campaign to run for a full month, which allowed it to become part of the Super Bowl hype in the weeks leading up to and following the game.\nThis video content strategy paid off. After the campaign generated more than 247 million impressions, Hyundai became a big brand winner of the AdBlitz 2022 contest, an honor given to brands who receive the most views on their Super Bowl commercial. Additionally, by starting its campaign early during off-peak days, the brand also reduced its cost per unique view by 50% compared to a traditional Super Bowl buy.\nFor Pride Month this year, bubly partnered with the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, and the chosen families and safe places that allow its members to flourish. As part of the partnership, the brand created a short film called Coming Home, which offered a simple, yet powerful message: Everyone deserves a family.\nTo promote the film and ensure it got the viewership and engagement it deserved, bubly knew it was important to find the right platform. As Conor Dwyer, brand communications lead at PepsiCo, explains, \u201cYouTube was among the only platforms where we could functionally and efficiently deliver a video ad that surpassed two minutes and reach an audience already primed for viewing long-form content.\u201d YouTube also helped bubly\u2019s film reach a wider range of relevant audiences through behavioral and contextual targeting, including affinity segments like LGBTQ Content Enthusiasts, and ensure it appeared alongside relevant content.\nWith the power of YouTube behind it, the film earned more than 6 million views and a view rate above 50%. The film also drove heightened interest in the brand, which saw a 1091% relative lift in searches for \u201cbubly.\u201d\nMondel\u0113z decided to promote its Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand during Italy\u2019s biggest national music festival and song contest, the Sanremo Music Festival. This involved sponsoring the YouTube channels for the artists in the festival and running a YouTube homepage masthead during the weeklong event. The brand chose YouTube because it knew the platform would be ideal for immersing in the excitement of the festival and reaching as many music fans as possible. It was a smart strategy, as music streaming had been growing in popularity since the start of the pandemic, especially on YouTube.\nTo reach the largest online audience possible, Mondel\u0113z ran a 25% share of voice YouTube campaign, which guarantees advertisers a set percentage of ads around certain content groups. For Mondel\u0113z, that meant its campaign could run on the official YouTube channels of all the top artists competing in the Sanremo festival. Mondel\u0113z not only extended its campaign reach by leaning into the momentum from the main event, but also by tapping into the excitement before, during, and after the festival.\nMondel\u0113z also secured a YouTube masthead ad exclusively on connected TV. This helped the brand reach a new, fast-growing base of connected TV viewers and keep the Philadelphia brand front and center over the course of the festival.\nIn the end, Mondel\u0113z\u2019 connected TV masthead increased its reach by 30%, and the overall campaign successfully reached 5.4 million unique users, garnering almost 20 million impressions in just 14 days.\nAs video viewers increasingly gravitate online, innovative companies like Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z show that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply run ads during tentpole moments. Instead, these companies found wider audiences and increased brand awareness by leveraging YouTube to tap into the subculture and tangential moments around the Super Bowl, Pride Month, and Sanremo Music Festival. Their strategies and resulting success can inspire brands of all sizes to find greater reach and new fans on YouTube."

        "output": "A few weeks ago, I experienced a quintessential New York moment. I was double parked on the busy street outside my New York City apartment, desperately trying to install a car seat I had recently purchased for my 3-year-old daughter. At any moment, I knew I could be honked at for blocking other cars.\nSo I quickly whipped out my phone and headed to the Car Seat Lady on YouTube, a channel I frequently consult when I\u2019m in the market to buy a new car seat and in stressful parenting moments like this. There, I knew I could find step-by-step instructions and incredibly accurate estimates of how long it would take someone like me to install a brand-new car seat in a high-pressure situation.\nMy experience isn\u2019t unique. People all over the world turn to YouTube for help with products they just bought. In fact, they\u2019re relying on YouTube for guidance and information during every part of their shopping journey, whether they\u2019re watching unboxing videos, getting product reviews, or learning from how-to videos. This is particularly true of Gen Z, who say that YouTube is more likely than other video and social media platform to meet their top shopping needs.1\nBut what exactly makes YouTube such a magnet for shoppers? And how can brands benefit from this close relationship between YouTube and its audience? To find out, we partnered with Talk Shoppe to conduct an extensive, qualitative research study and surveyed thousands of video users in the U.S. From our findings, we\u2019ve extracted three shopping insights that can help build brand loyalty and create repeat customers on YouTube.\nYes, discovering new and exciting brands online is important to shoppers. But what they value even more is finding reliable, trustworthy information that will help them buy a product with confidence. And, according to our research, viewers say YouTube ranks no. 1 against video services and social media platforms in key shopping needs, like finding honest information and feeling good about their purchases.2\nYouTube creators are a large part of the reason why people view the platform as a source of solid information, with 87% of viewers agreeing that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.3 As one of our survey participants said, \u201cYouTubers often give updates on how the product is doing three, six, or 12 months after purchasing, and they also will warn you about things to look out for.\u201d\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, 24 markets (AR, AU, BR, CL, CO, FR, DE, ID, IT, IN, JP, KR, MX, PE, PH, NZ, NL, ES, SE, TH, VN, AE, U.K., U.S.), n=48,000, 18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 20, 2021\u2013Feb. 19, 2022.\nTo explore this further, we spoke with creator-turned-entrepreneur Cassey Ho about how building trust with her YouTube followers contributed to the success of her direct-to-consumer brand, Popflex.\nFor over 13 years, Ho established herself as an authentic, trustworthy creator and CEO by sharing free workout videos on her Blogilates YouTube channel. \u201cFans would see me wearing my products or showcasing them in the background. They started asking me for a longer hoodie or a hoodie with a bigger hood to cover their long hair. What has really helped me build trust \u2026 is that I will take those comments as inspiration to develop my products. People felt heard.\u201d\nWhen we asked Gen Z what they prioritize when they shop using video or social platforms, they ranked finding a brand they love significantly higher than finding something trendy.4 This, of course, is great news for brands who hope to become a go-to destination for Gen Z and other shoppers. But exactly how do they become that universally loved brand? They can achieve this by creating a positive shopping experience that encourages people to buy from them again and again.\nThe key to a positive shopping experience is giving people product information they can trust, which will make them more satisfied with their final purchase. And our research showed that YouTube helps brands build this basis of trust. As one of our Gen Z survey participants stated, \u201cAfter buying something that I\u2019ve actually done research on [through] YouTube, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever returned anything.\u201d YouTube also helps brands win customers\u2019 loyalty, with 85% of people who use YouTube in their shopping journey saying they have purchased or planned to purchase a brand again.5\nSource: Google/TalkShoppe, U.S., Social Commerce and Video Shopping study, n=2,000 gen. pop. 18\u201364, Aug. 2022.\nWhile shoppers trust creators\u2019 recommendations and the information they find on YouTube, can the same be said about video ads? As part of our research, Talk Shoppe conducted a test to find out how people really feel about the ads they see. They created an ad for an imaginary coffee brand and showed survey participants how this ad might look on different online platforms. Participants were then asked to quickly associate the brand in the ad with certain words.\nThe test results showed that people trusted a brand much more when they saw it on a platform they trusted. More specifically, ads on YouTube were rated significantly more trustworthy, established, and credible than they were on every other platform.6 Thus, our research shows that brands can enjoy a halo effect \u2014 positive association \u2014 from the platforms or services they advertise on, which is vital information for brand marketers who want to get the most out of their media dollars.\nThese three shopper insights can help brands leverage the implicit trust people have in YouTube and its creators. By tapping into the satisfaction shoppers have when YouTube is part of their shopping journey and by benefiting from YouTube\u2019s halo effect, brands can turn one-time buyers into long-term loyal, repeat customers."

        "output": "If you ask a room full of advertisers, \u201cWhat makes a good video ad?\u201d you\u2019ll likely get a wide range of responses. But most will agree that good creative drives results. According to Nielsen, creative is responsible for almost half of a campaign\u2019s success.1 And when I recently ran a YouTube CMO roundtable, many clients spoke to creative customization and experimentation as key components of their success. Their experiences support the insight that relevance to viewers maximizes impact. Because different content resonates with different viewers, campaigns containing several versions of the same creative, each tailored to a specific audience, can be very effective.\nAdvancements in technology have led viewers to expect more relevance, thanks to a proliferation of choice. Now, ad creative must transform to meet those expectations. We developed Ads Creative Studio to streamline the production process by helping brands and agencies cut down on time and costs, and to facilitate collaboration between media and creative teams. Here\u2019s how two brands and an agency used the platform to create more effective ads.\nCustomization has always been a key part of PepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy, but their sparkling water brand bubly\u2019s impact on brand associations still had to be tested. The team wanted to find out how customized video ads for the brand might encourage their ideal audiences to associate it with house parties, barbecues, sports viewing, and other consumption moments. The goal? To deliver on a brief to better understand the consumer and eventually win them over.\nWith this experiment, PepsiCo wanted to gauge which of those occasion-specific messages, when aimed at relevant audiences, would resonate the most. With Ads Creative Studio, the process of building out a collection of customized assets became smoother and more efficient. The suite of tools allowed the teams to keep production internal by housing all design elements on a single platform.\n\u201cPrior to using Ads Creative Studio for video customization, we planned a high-level creative and targeting approach,\u201d said Terrence McLaughlin, associate marketing manager at PepsiCo. However, after using the tool to inventory creative variables to personalize, each with its own designated audience, they realized they had to adapt their creative process to be more tactical. \u201cAfter seeing the Ads Creative Studio user flow, we had to break down the elements of our proposed creative to mimic the framework in the platform.\u201d\nWith a single tool, the PepsiCo team was able to standardize processes across functions. As a result, the team found that campaigns with creative depicting social gathering and food pairing situations were most effective at driving brand lift. Equipped with that knowledge, teams can now craft bubly\u2019s stories around themes they know resonate with audiences they want to reach.\nWhen General Motors South America wanted to boost brand awareness of the Cruze 5 model, they decided to lean on customization beyond the basics. Drawing on Google insights, they created an audience strategy that relied on a collection of 14 different groups, including affinity audiences like \u201coutdoor enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cthrill seekers,\u201d and \u201cbeachbound travelers,\u201d as well as contextual audiences: those watching various types of auto-related content on YouTube. Each of these 14 groups would see an ad customized specifically to what would resonate with them.\nThe team was faced with the question of how to produce 14 unique ads, without sacrificing time, budget, or resources. They opted to try Ads Creative Studio.\n\u201cIt allows you to increase productivity and efficiency, both creatively and from media costs and metrics,\u201d said Gianluca Schinocca, media coordinator for GM Argentina. \u201cAmong the many benefits of Ads Creative Studio, production time saving and the large amount of videos produced are the ones that we found most impactful. We also reduced 30% in terms of costs, and, after the campaign, we noticed a huge increase in product searches.\u201d\nFor a true win, GM knew they would need measurable results in brand lift and search. In the end, with a 56% increase in Google searches for \u201cchevrolet cruze\u201d2 and a cost per view 32% less than the industry benchmark, the experiment was a success.\nFrom the agency perspective, Ads Creative Studio can eliminate the swirl that sometimes comes with ambitious undertakings. Creative agencies around the world are constantly dealing with gridlock in approvals and workflows. Men in Green, a Dutch creative agency, found that the suite of tools made it easier for designers to share and edit work. \u201cIt is the perfect solution for our challenge,\u201d said Jaap den Hertog, founder and CEO of Men in Green. \u201cIt gives a risk-free environment for designers to build [ad] creatives. It also allows for easy collaboration between multiple designers.\u201d\nPreviously, to maintain high production standards, Men in Green had strict quality controls in place that only allowed for senior designers to produce data-driven ad creatives within Display & Video 360. That meant junior designers could not create design variations, even when the team needed them. Because Ads Creative Studio is integrated into Display & Video 360, junior designers can now make their own ad creatives, halving the time it takes to deliver work and allowing senior designers to focus on quality assurance and publishing.\nTo their clients\u2019 delight, the data-driven ad creatives with tailored messaging decreased production costs significantly. When leading bath and body brand company Rituals was looking for a way to promote their Easter collection, Men in Green used templates to create personalized messages for each market. Not only did they save time and resources, but they also saw a 278% higher click-through rate, 64% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and 103% higher conversion rate compared to standard IAB banners.\nCreative is fundamental to campaign success. No matter what your goals are, a centralized suite of tools can be used to drive both efficiency and scale. By reducing barriers and enhancing efficiency, Ads Creative Studio makes it easier for teams to collaborate and create personalized assets quickly, at low cost. Coupled with video experimentation, these tools allowed three different organizations to determine the most effective story to engage each of their unique audiences."

        "output": "To explore the future impact of transformational changes in the creative realm, Google is partnering with Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 industry trailblazers on the Open Creative Project: an effort that brings together market analysis and insights from a series of in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders to encourage dialogue about the future of our industry. Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, shares early takeaways from the project.\nThe term \u201ccreative\u201d used to refer to a special class within the ad world: teams with a particular skill set who often sat apart, literally and figuratively, from the rest of their organizations. But when a pandemic forced all of us into digital spaces as safe havens to work and play, \u201ccreative\u201d took on a larger meaning.\nPeople who never went to design school or drafted a creative brief got more comfortable being their authentic selves online. Unknown chefs shared their passion for cooking on YouTube and discovered a global audience hungry for more. Gamers live streamed their adventures to thousands \u2014 sometimes millions \u2014 of rapt fans. In myriad new ways and spaces, everyday people started to share their stories, and some even partnered with brands to become powerful co-storytellers.\nMarketers and agencies, too, had to get more creative in solving clients\u2019 challenges, forging meaningful connections with consumers, and measuring success. And as marketers learned how to leverage new tools for creative automation, experimentation, assistance, and measurement, they grew more comfortable sharing ownership of a brand identity with the online communities organically remixing it. Together with those communities, they remade marketing and found fresh opportunities.\nAll of this adds up to more than just a \u201cthings are different now\u201d moment.\nFor us at Google, the combination of changes in consumer behavior, the rise of machine learning, the flourishing of user expression in unscripted spaces, and macroeconomic pressures felt like an inflection point for the industry, one where creative is poised to become the last unfair advantage.\nWith automation flattening media-driven returns, creative is becoming one of the most effective levers to drive differentiation and return on investment, and creative spend is increasing faster than media spend (6% versus 5% annually between 2018 and 2021).1 Knowing that these trends deserved a deep dive, we partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 including Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 creative industry trailblazers \u2014 on what we\u2019re calling the Open Creative Project.\nThrough intensive market analysis and in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders and trailblazers, we\u2019ve begun a thorough exploration of the why, the how, and the future impact of transformational changes already underway in the creative arena. And, over and over, we\u2019ve seen that concepts that once felt oppositional \u2014 art and science, unscripted expression and brand voice, advertising creators and users, brand and performance, imagination and automation \u2014 are increasingly interdependent.\nOur goal is to spark a new dialogue focused on the role creative will play in the broader advertising industry over the next three to five years. While this conversation will surely be shaped by the contributions and feedback of the entire advertising industry, we\u2019ve already keyed in on a few areas that present some of the biggest opportunities for marketers and brands.\nA natural place to start is with the rise of the creator economy, one of the strongest signals we have of where the future of creative \u2014 and all of marketing \u2014 is headed.\nThe explosion of truly unique and innovative content the ad industry has seen over the past three years is a direct product of a global cohort of diverse new voices adding their perspectives and contributions to the traditional marketing mix across old and new platforms. Case in point: Influencer marketing payments to creators for creative advertising services grew 50% annually between 2018 and 2021.2\nThe term \u201cowned media\u201d is now a relative one. Not only does every consumer have the tools to amplify, challenge, or riff on your brand\u2019s message through their personal channels and unscripted spaces, but so do thousands of influential creators with their own massive audiences and points of view.\nAnd experimentation, the willingness to try something new or different that\u2019s so key to creativity, is fast becoming a core competency \u2014 especially with the proliferation of tools that enable experimentation.\nThere are lessons here for organizations and brands ready to break creativity out of its silo. By being open to more active collaboration with creators around a shared point of view, brands can foster a more exciting and authentic conversation with their audiences. And there is value in thinking about the \u201ccreative team\u201d as everyone from CEO to the finance team.\nThere\u2019s no question that the relationships between digital platforms and the people who use them are being reshaped.\nBut amid the noise of an internet that offers everything, all the time, how can brands connect with the right people in a way that sticks? The answer lies in the new value exchange that\u2019s redefining how, when, and why brands earn people\u2019s attention, satisfaction, and trust. It\u2019s an exchange that only works reciprocally.\nIn other words, people already understand data\u2019s value for advertisers. When people appreciate the value and benefits they receive from the data they share, the more they trust a brand to handle that data responsibly, and the more comfortable they are with the exchange.\nTo provide a convincing answer to the consumer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d, brands have to deliver empathy at scale by demonstrating a deep understanding of every customer\u2019s (and potential customer\u2019s) needs and the company\u2019s ability to meet those needs. And there\u2019s no better way to speak authentically to the widest possible audience, in the most personal terms, than great creative.\nWith all of the hats they must wear today, it\u2019s fair for marketers to wonder, \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\nBut marketers and agencies can make their jobs simpler and easier on multiple fronts by doing a single thing: embracing automation as a collaborator rather than a competitor. That\u2019s because automation and machine learning can do things that human brains can\u2019t do: connect dots at scale, uncover new insights, free up time across teams, and infuse even more creativity into organizations.\nTake the example of measurement. With so many new content formats, marketers have more data to measure than ever before. But data is only as useful as our ability to interpret and apply it, and automation is a proven tool to drive better performance via modeling.\nAdvertisers are beginning to realize this. Third-party ad technology that supports creativity \u2014 including digital asset management, dynamic creative optimization, advertising attribution, creative applications, and influencer marketing platforms \u2014 saw growth rates ranging from 10% to 30% annually between 2020 and 2021.3\nSo the shift is underway. Of course, automation-enabled measurement doesn\u2019t only make for better creative. Creative thinking can improve the ways we measure.\nToday\u2019s shopping experience extends far outside the store and into the live-streaming, social, and physical worlds.\nAnd as the creator economy flowers across augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming, brands are coming to life across a multiplicity of new dimensions. The implication for brands? Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to convert, and the entire commerce journey is an ever-expanding web of touchpoints where brand building can happen at any time.\nBrands that unlock new ways to stand out in the age of everywhere commerce will define the future of creative advertising.\nWith these ideas as thought-starters, on behalf of our Open Creative Project co-collaborators, we\u2019re excited to open up the conversation to a wider audience. In the coming months, we\u2019ll invite you to dive into a full version of the research report summarized here, followed by a series of contributions from some of the leading voices in creative advertising. We look forward to adding their insights, and more from across the industry, as we endeavor to explore, define, and invent the future of creative, together."

        "output": "Kristen O\u2019Hara is the VP of brand and agency solutions at Google. Here, she spotlights three brands piloting new approaches and stretching their thinking to capture new growth opportunities amid uncertainty.\nIn this current uncertain environment, made more challenging by conflicting news headlines, marketers may have more questions than answers. Strategic decisions tend to get magnified in times like these, and brands often respond by leaning into what they know: tried-and-true advertising tactics that deliver consistent results. While doubling down on what\u2019s familiar is better than doing nothing at all, marketers shouldn\u2019t stop there.\nSearch, video, and insights are tried-and-true advertising channels. Brands know how to leverage them to capture growth and build resilience. But brands also need to supplement their trusted playbooks with the increased insight, speed, and agility that comes from machine learning and automation. We call this combination of tried-and-true approaches and fresh new ways of working the \u201ctried-and-new.\u201d\nHaving served in a variety of roles across the industry, including CMO at Time Warner and chief business officer at Hearst, I\u2019ve experienced challenging times firsthand. Managing the marketing budgets and strategies that many of you hold right now through moments of uncertainty is the moment to focus on purposeful experimentation and lean into the tried-and-new framework. This doesn\u2019t require dramatic changes or major new investments. What it does require is prioritization, flexibility, and a learning mindset. Many leading brands have used this approach to go beyond the performance-oriented tools they\u2019ve relied on in the past to drive better business outcomes. Here are the big takeaways.\nConsumer behaviors, needs, and preferences change from moment to moment, which we see reflected in search. Among the billions of searches on Google everyday, 15% are queries we\u2019ve never seen.1\nWe know that search drives conversions. But with machine learning, you can quickly identify which new searches (or users) are most valuable to your business based on your goals. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve found that full search automation can help advertisers increase conversions by up to 20% for a similar cost per acquisition.2 This is a huge uptick when you are being asked to squeeze more value from every dollar and every campaign.\nWe can see this in action with Rothy\u2019s, a shoe and accessory retailer that relies on video and lifestyle imagery to showcase the quality and colorful nature of their products. The brand adopted automation to surface creative assets to customers at scale across all of Google\u2019s channels, including Search, Display, Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. At first Rothy\u2019s hesitated to automate such important decisions, but \u201cthe results spoke for themselves,\u201d explains Kate Barrows, Rothy\u2019s VP of growth. \u201cAutomation stays on top of customer trends and behavior faster than we can.\u201d The brand grew conversions by 60% and increased revenue by 59%.\nWhat could your brand achieve by offloading commoditized and manual tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work? When you think in those terms, you will begin to see automation as a business multiplier that scales what\u2019s working for your brand, your team, and your partners.\nRemoving tedious tasks, like manually setting your dayparting strategy or building keyword lists, enables your most valuable resource, your people, to infuse more of their own judgment, expertise, and ingenuity into the work. This may mean having the time to focus on building a strategy that expands beyond lower-funnel strategies to develop more holistic, full-funnel marketing campaigns. Or it\u2019s a chance to go deeper on your creative strategy.\nDiscovery+, the streaming platform, adopted Performance Max to improve how it optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. In this case, automation unlocked new audience trends that Discovery+ used to better refine the creative and messaging around their shows. This also freed up time to reinvest into developing a comprehensive media strategy to further drive growth. The strategy worked: Discovery+ increased incremental subscriptions by 17% and decreased cost of acquisition by 21% in a highly competitive category.\nMarketing often suffers from the misperception that it operates as a cost center. Reframing marketing as a growth driver requires speaking a new language, moving beyond proxy metrics like brand awareness or engagement to focus on business performance. Speaking a shared language with the CFO means measuring business outcomes through better use of data, technology, and machine learning.\nWhen you know the value of your customers and you combine that knowledge with AI and machine learning, your campaigns can begin to shift advertising dollars in real time to the most profitable pockets of demand. This is critical, because tying incremental marketing investments to year-over-year sales growth not only increases revenue but also reduces acquisition costs, leading to more profitable revenue. In fact, CMOs who can translate their metrics into business impact are 37% more likely to report revenue growth compared to leaders that communicate strictly in marketing language.3\nFor example, as part of its first-party data strategy, PepsiCo invested in strengthening direct relationships with their consumers by offering a loyalty rewards program that personalizes experiences and optimizes offers based on the individual\u2019s preferences. This enabled their teams to demonstrate results that tied more directly to sales, in contrast with traditional tactics like mass distributions, promotions, and broad communications that were harder to measure. For example, the food and beverage brand embedded its first-party data in its media planning and buying on YouTube. Not only did their media efficiency improve, but for some campaigns ROI increased by 3X. They also leverage this data to make better informed business decisions on new flavor testings, focus groups, and product samplings.\nDelivering continued growth means striking a balance between tested techniques that deliver consistent returns, and the potential upside of new ideas. Brave marketers have long championed this shift. It\u2019s about remaining agile to manage through the now, while being ready for what\u2019s next."

        "output": "Digital transformation is a journey, not a destination. While every journey will be different, we can learn from leading brands as they advance their digital maturity. Here, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global CMO, Aude Gandon, takes us through the company\u2019s approach to global digital marketing.\nStaying relevant in today\u2019s dynamic environment requires embracing constant change. And as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global Chief Marketing Officer, my mission is to accelerate our marketing digital transformation across the entire organization.\nAs a 156-year-old company with more than 2,000 brands \u2014 including icons like Kit Kat, Nespresso, and Purina \u2014 we believe that data and technology, along with our organization\u2019s ability to adopt and activate quickly, are key to maintaining a competitive advantage.\nPart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s success lies in how we\u2019re able to attribute our digital investments to our top and bottom lines. We recently updated our investors on our digital transformation journey by explaining how we\u2019re using data to reach and resonate with consumers at scale, and how that powers growth across our portfolio.\nIn particular, we\u2019ve identified three key areas that are critical to our success and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in: privacy-preserving fundamentals, valuable consumer connections, and ongoing experimentation. Here\u2019s how we approach each one.\nThe first key to our success is a sharp focus on privacy-preserving fundamentals. A critical part of my role as global CMO is to help Nestl\u00e9 navigate the changing advertising landscape, especially as third-party data collection phases out. By treating data protection and privacy as paramount, we've accelerated the use of privacy-preserving technologies across our organization, ensuring that our first-party strategy is future-proof. This means our brands can access high-quality data and continue to deliver personalized experiences online.\nTo drive our privacy strategy, we\u2019ve developed and delivered a global advertising-technology roadmap across all our markets and brands. Doing so has helped us take advantage of privacy features, like consent mode within Google Analytics 4 (GA4), through which we can communicate users\u2019 cookie- and app-identifier consent status to Google. Tags will then automatically adjust behavior and respect users\u2019 choices. In turn, we\u2019re able to safely improve our understanding of consumers across platforms and deliver richer experiences online.\nLastly, we recognize that staying up-to-date on new privacy capabilities requires us to invest in upskilling programs for our talented teams of brand builders around the world. By empowering our marketers to deeply understand the impact and value a technology unlocks, we can accelerate our transformation and put our company on the path to competitive advantage.\nOur second key focus is on building and fostering valuable consumer connections. In particular, our goal is to reach 400 million consumers with our first-party database by 2025. Having direct access to our first-party data \u2014 and turning this data into actionable insight \u2014 is a critical competitive advantage with immediate value for our brands.\nBy moving toward a first-party, data-driven approach and leveraging Google\u2019s privacy-preserving advertising and analytics tools, we\u2019ve increased our ability to offer personalized solutions in real time, track ROI, and improve sales performance. This ultimately helps us make smarter investments, especially amid economic uncertainty, when it is more critical than ever to understand the value of media spend.\nOne powerful example of this is our food brand Maggi\u2019s use of first-party data to inform dynamic ad creative and better connect with consumers in the Middle East during seasonal moments and other special occasions. By taking this approach, the Maggi team improved its return on ad spend by 25%.\nAnother example is how we leverage new audience capabilities to derive value from our first-party data. Solutions such as Google\u2019s advanced look-alike modeling, currently available in beta, gives us more transparency and control when building audience segments by combining our first-party data with Google\u2019s consumer intent signals. Already, this technology has improved our media efficiency and helped drive a 25% uplift in ad recall for one of our pet care brands in the U.K.\nOur final key focus is on experimentation and fostering a culture of experimentation across our marketing teams. To do this, we lean heavily on cloud capabilities that give us the flexibility to try new technologies while strengthening consumer privacy and growing our first-party data. Our \u201cCloud-in-a-Box\u201d program, for example, gives our brands scalable blueprints to unlock the value of machine learning and other predictive technology.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice for our market-leading Nescaf\u00e9 coffee brand in Thailand. Using Cloud-in-a-Box, the Nescaf\u00e9 team routed large volumes of past campaign data to Google Cloud, then used machine learning to predict which creative messages paired with which audiences to deliver the best results on YouTube.\nBy taking this approach, Nescaf\u00e9 improved its cost per view by 17% and invested the money it saved to reach additional audiences, all while boosting ad recall 12%. Most importantly, the team saw up to 90% accuracy in the model\u2019s predictions, when compared with outcomes from the actual campaign.\nBuilding brands that consumers love remains our core marketing ambition. Our continued investment in digital transformation focuses us on understanding and using the power of data and technology to fuel growth potential for tomorrow.\nBy driving a consistent global marketing strategy across the organization, our team has been able to drive change at scale, embracing data and technology to build competitiveness. Our strategic priorities are helping us build resilience through uncertainty, positioning Nestl\u00e9 to achieve long-term growth."

        "output": "Changes are afoot in how people spend their money. Consumers are being more intentional with purchases, making fewer impulse buys, considering more brands, and exploring multiple commerce platforms. Businesses need to move quickly to keep up with this swerve in shopper mindsets, but it can be hard to put change into action amid uncertainty.\nFinding the right balance between tested strategies and emerging tech innovations can revitalize marketing approaches and power long-term growth. At Google, we call this the tried-and-new approach. It\u2019s about doubling down on proven tactics while leaning into new technology to drive success.\nWhat does this look like in practice? We\u2019ve identified a few strategies that position businesses to adopt the tried-and-new, along with examples of two innovative companies that are using Google\u2019s tools to pivot their growth marketing strategy.\nPeople spend more time researching purchase decisions than they once did, and they\u2019re conducting this research across a growing array of platforms. With this change, automation tools have become a critical way for brands to meet their customers across these digital touchpoints.\nA good example of this comes from Est\u00e9e Lauder in Thailand. Despite being one of the world\u2019s largest cosmetic brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder was challenged to keep up with customer search demand as new search queries and keyword combinations emerged daily. People were no longer just searching for terms like \u201cserum,\u201d but new specific searches like \u201cbest serum for the best price\u201d and \u201cbest serum for brightening skin.\u201d\nThe company decided to approach the problem using automation. To capture and convert prospective customers at scale, Est\u00e9e Lauder used Google\u2019s broad match to automate identification of consumers\u2019 keyword searches to make their ads more relevant to prospective customers. The company also adopted Dynamic Search Ads to find exactly what consumers were searching for on Google and used that data to target their ads and fill gaps in their keyword-based campaigns.\nAs a result, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s media performance shot up. Compared to traditional branded keyword campaigns, the company experienced a 15% increase in return on ad spend, a more than 16% rise in conversion value, and an 11% lift in average purchase size.\nKnowing how to reach the most valuable customers and others like them at scale is a powerful growth multiplier. Using automated solutions allows businesses to do this, while controlling what they pay for customer acquisition and tailoring messages to attract customer attention.\nMarketers know they need to measure what matters, but what are the most important metrics when the economic outlook is in flux? Uncertainty signals the need to move beyond traditional proxy marketing metrics and toward the measurement of real business outcomes.\nArizona State University (ASU) had a business goal to enroll more online students for the 2022\u20132023 school year than the year prior \u2014 no small aim given years of declining enrollment across U.S. postsecondary institutions.\nTo drive this outcome, ASU partnered with Google data scientists to use advanced automation solutions in combination with first-party data to identify people who were most likely to enroll at the institution.\nBut ASU needed to embrace new measurement in order to track the results of these solutions and track progress against its goal. The university leaned in to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and adopted Google Tag Manager\u2019s (GTM) server-side tracking. This allowed ASU to measure the results of its first-party targeting, resulting in a 10% increase in observable conversions on its site and an 8% increase in the on-page conversion rate. Adopting GTM tagging also drove a 25% improvement in page load time and 18% improvement in search engine results page position.\nThis increase in conversions drove remarkable impact. For the 2022 fall semester, ASU Online increased enrollment by 6.9% compared to 2021, setting a record for incoming students.\nNew automation solutions handily harnessed the scale of platforms, helping ASU reach the people who were most likely to act at lower cost. And it was able to measure and track this progress in real time using privacy-safe solutions within GA4.\nPreparing for what\u2019s next is always daunting \u2014 and all the more during times of rapid change.\nBut new marketing strategy tools available today can help to augment traditional strategies, deliver reliable results, and drive long-term growth, no matter what disruptions surface. Use the tried-and-new and make your marketing go further."

The study revealed that certain creative elements have a measurable impact on marketing objectives. From these, we determined the ABCDs for Awareness.\nNo matter how long your brand has been around, cutting through the clutter can be a challenge. Your solution or market position might take a while for people to digest before they are ready to embrace you. To help you craft an ad that drives brand awareness, we\u2019ve refined the ABCDs based on what has worked for brands on YouTube in the past.\nPretend you\u2019re a creative on the Fishos account. Your storyboard, below, is ready for review. What else could you add?\nAudio is your superpower for getting people to pay attention. Embrace elements like voice-over, music, and sound effects to amplify your on-screen messaging. The power of the human voice is a great way to connect with people, and it can add personality through your choice of talent and delivery style.\nIncorporate multiple branding opportunities to get noticed and be remembered. Frequency plus variety is key. From logo to tagline and mascots to pack shots, more points of branding will give you more impact.\nAs humans, we can\u2019t help but be drawn to other humans. So featuring people in your story lends emotional context to scenes and creates connection quickly. Showing people using your product is one proven way to demonstrate its benefits. Celebrities and influencers can also inspire engagement, as can reflecting the diversity of the real world.\nJust as in the core ABCDs, make sure your ad gives people clear and simple instructions.\nNow compare the Awareness version of the ad with the version based on the general ABCDs. While both are memorable, our slightly reworked version spends a bit more time introducing the product to new audiences.\nFor more details download the ABCDs Playbook."

I'd like you to incorporate the following facts. \n- Customers are more likely to engage with and do business with sustainable brands\n- Many people understand their environmental impact but are unable to afford or access sustainable options\n- Highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are cost or time-saving to encourage sustainable choices\n- Dramatic images of environmental destruction may overwhelm individuals and decrease feelings of efficacy\n- Brands should provide concrete, small-scale actions and evidence to support their sustainability claims",
        "input": "",
        "output": "People encounter more sustainability-related brand messages than ever, and with good reason: According to a recent Harris Poll survey sponsored by Google Cloud, the vast majority (85%) of executives acknowledge that customers are more likely to engage and do business with sustainable brands. Brand commitments to sustainability have proliferated, with sustainability marketing strategies amplifying those commitments \u2014 on food packaging, in car ads, even on energy bills. That means people see a ton of messages about the environment throughout the day. Those messages represent many opportunities to appeal to customers\u2019 values. How they are conveyed is critical to building brand trust.\nWe asked more than 3,000 Americans of different backgrounds to tell us about sustainability messaging that did not resonate with them to get a better understanding of how to connect on this important issue. Using a type of AI called natural language processing, we clustered and analyzed thousands of opinions by theme to identify how people felt about certain visuals, copy, and creative approaches. Here are three of the most common sustainability marketing pitfalls our research revealed.\nU.S. survey respondents knew which parts of their day-to-day consumption were environmentally unsustainable, citing things like plastic use and driving, but they expressed frustration when they couldn\u2019t afford to change their habits.1\n\u201cI wanted to start using compostable and plastic-free products but could not afford them.\u201d\n\u201cI feel helpless when considering the impact of fossil fuel consumption. I can\u2019t help driving my car when I need to.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to buy an EV, but cannot afford it. I would also like solar panels, cannot afford those either.\u201d\nEducational campaigns can have limited or negative impact when they become constant reminders of barriers to change. Awareness of a sustainability-related problem is rarely the sole cause of inaction. Many people today understand their environmental impact and want to do something about it, but not everyone is in a position to opt into a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, paper straws, though better for the environment, are not universally accessible. Walking or taking the bus to work isn\u2019t always feasible. Meanwhile, some sustainable options can be hard to find or more expensive than the default.\nTo avoid this pitfall, highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are also cost or timesaving. Such \u201cco-benefits\u201d of climate action enable people to make the best choices for their own specific sets of circumstances. Case in point: Google Maps now shows the most fuel-efficient routes, which are often the fastest. Interest in fuel efficiency has grown globally over the past year.2 By integrating sustainability into existing products, brands can enhance people\u2019s lifestyles, rather than interrupt or criticize them. Social proof is a powerful motivator, but research shows people underestimate just how many others are taking environmental action. To remedy this, we created a website for Earth Day that highlights climate actions that have gained traction over the last few years and a variety of steps people can take toward adoption.\nWhile dramatic images of destroyed environments may emphasize the urgency of global action, they may also be overwhelming to individuals. When asked to describe \u201cactions or attitudes that could make people feel bad about their impact on the environment,\u201d many U.S. survey respondents pointed to images of landscapes ruined by trash, fires, or pollution, while some pointed to images of animal suffering.3\nDepicting the severity of an issue through poignant creative is a common way to engage people in a cause. Conveying the size of the problem with great urgency should, in theory, motivate people to act. While this may be effective for certain causes, it can sometimes be detrimental to others. Illustrating a massive phenomenon like climate change can easily overwhelm people and decrease feelings of individual efficacy.4\n\u201cI\u2019m only one person. I can\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing pictures and videos of the giant garbage pile in the ocean that is now bigger than the state of Texas ... made my stomach hurt. But I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI always feel bad when I see the changing climate\u2019s effect on animals. \u2026 I feel a little helpless.\u201d\nBrands and companies still have a place when it comes to helping people make positive changes in their daily lives. They just have to put those contributions in context. Rather than depict the harrowing consequences of inaction, focus instead on concrete, small-scale actions that add up to visible improvements. Even one-time changes that lessen impact over time \u2014 such as replacing light bulbs with LEDs \u2014 can empower customers to participate.\nConsider using before-and-after visualizations that show the value of individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 combined efforts. Time-lapse videos can illustrate outcomes in powerful ways. Such visuals show that we haven\u2019t gone past a point of no return and that measures to address the problem can still be effective. Reporting an initiative\u2019s success to date can also make people want to be a part of the solution.\nPeople may react negatively to being told what to do by brands. This type of purpose-driven advertising can be met with skepticism, with some viewing it as greenwashing. Many U.S. survey respondents pointed to insufficient evidence as a barrier to believing a company\u2019s sustainability claims.5\n\u201cMost of the time [sustainable messaging] is just greenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they can show proof [of] what they\u2019re doing to protect the environment, I don\u2019t fully believe it.\u201d\nThe sentiments align with results from a global survey of top-level executives that had nearly 6 out of 10 (59%) admitting to overstating \u2014 or inaccurately representing \u2014 their sustainability activities. Reporting hard metrics can be an effective inoculation against exaggeration. If you are able to substantiate the value of your offerings, those who care about the cause might consider your proposition. At the very least, they might do some research on their end to learn more about your brand and its climate action goals.\nEffective sustainability marketing and messaging is all about delivering reliable information to help people make better choices in the context of their lives. It\u2019s also about unearthing essential data so that people can gauge and compare the impact of different offerings. For retailers, this might mean introducing features that highlight brands carrying Energy Star-certified products, allowing shoppers to filter for energy-efficient options with a single click.\nThe climate crisis is an urgent matter and individual changes to our lifestyles and behavior have an impact. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve \u201cglobal net-zero\u201d by 2050 are linked to consumer choices.6\nWhile businesses and governments have an opportunity to lead the charge, they also have a critical role to play in making sustainable living more accessible and inclusive for all \u2014 by considering the multifaceted lives of customers who are already well aware of the changes they want to make."

        "output": "Kelsey Davis, founder and CEO of Cllctve, a global community portfolio platform that helps brands discover and connect with creators, shares how Black creators are at the forefront of the shifting content landscape, and how brands can credit Black creativity beyond Black History Month. Davis has been featured as a next-gen leader in Forbes 30 Under 30, Adweek, and The New York Times, and is a recipient of the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund.\nGrowing up in Atlanta, I\u2019ve always been interested in the ways business and media converge, especially when it comes to Black culture. Studying video production in high school led me to make so many short films for the Y that they hired me as a freelancer. Local projects like these gave me more visibility and credibility in my community as a video producer. A friend helped me land my first gig with a Fortune 500 brand as a video producer for the Raurfest music festival. The success of the festival led to a meeting with executives at festival sponsor Coca-Cola to talk about my vision for future projects.\nAfter scaling productions early in Atlanta, I started studying film and entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. By my sophomore year, I had traveled the country working on creative projects with major brands, like Puma, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Land Rover, juggling high-profile projects with being a full-time student, finding a job, and building my personal brand as a freelance content creator. It was overwhelming, but I soon realized I was not alone. Many talented students wanted to build their portfolios and monetize their craft. They just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nI saw an opportunity to simplify the gig-finding and on-ramping processes so that young creators could turn their hobbies and passions into careers. From working with marketers, I knew that giving brands a way to discover and manage creator partnerships in one place could be game-changing. That\u2019s what led me to launch Cllctve, a portfolio platform that connects creators with their next opportunity and helps brands easily find and connect with Gen Z voices.\nThe content landscape is changing rapidly, and streaming is at the forefront. Digital video content is much more accessible to consumers, with a range of video lengths, types of content, and production quality. Over the past five years, there\u2019s been a significant rise in digital video-on-demand content as more consumers become creators of content as well. The more tools platforms give people to express themselves, the more content people will create, including branded content. Platforms like YouTube exemplify the cyclical relationship between consuming and creating content.\nThis is the age of the creator economy. At Cllctve, we believe that every human is a creator. We imagine a future where everyone has access to the tools, resources, and network to create the life they want. While many monetization avenues continue to grow, 77% of creators still depend on brand deals for revenue. And brands are looking for talent to help them produce their next campaigns.\nHistorically, Black creators have been among the leading spheres of influence driving the content economy forward. Whether it\u2019s through the storytelling of legendary writers like Toni Morrison, the choreography of revolutionary artists like Alvin Ailey, or the countless innovators of collective movements across genre and craft, Black creators have always achieved their creative visions by using their gifts to create through media that reaches the masses. 2015 proved to be a tipping point, when consumer data caught up to producer impact, and the results showed the influence of Black creators on the content landscape in real time. Black people are also some of the fastest to adopt streaming services. To move into representation beyond Black History Month, brands need to expand the types of Black talent they feature, pay Black creators equitably, and credit them for their contributions.\nBrands need to scout early and often for Black talent, expanding their search to places and people that are often overlooked. The increase in creator-economy activity nationwide gives brands the opportunity to look outside the traditional markets of New York and Los Angeles for talent. Given that the media has the potential to influence so much of how we see ourselves, brands need to expand representation beyond celebrities to emerging creators who deserve to be known. While it can feel more comfortable to reach out to the same circles, it\u2019s important for marketing teams to go beyond the usual roster to find young, diverse talent. Cllctve helps them find this talent by giving Gen Z creators a way to be discovered by brands trying to connect authentically with young audiences. One of the creators on our platform is based in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been able to work with local and national brands to produce content for them remotely, while staying close to his family.\nCompensation is a critical part of hiring the best talent, yet it\u2019s too often overlooked. The creator-economy wage gap between Black and white workers is disheartening, at 35%. This shows that when brands do decide to hire Black creators, it\u2019s at a significantly lower price point than their white counterparts. Even though the data shows that Black viewership is a leading driver of growth, the value these companies choose to invest in Black creators betrays a willingness to profit from Black art while underpaying Black artists.\nThe key to closing this gap is transparency. At Cllctve, we talk openly about how creators can think about pricing, and we encourage our creators to post their rates on their profile so there are no surprises when they connect with brands. We also provide prompts to help both brands and creators start the conversation. It\u2019s important to me that creators have the tools and resources that they need to feel empowered, and that brands know as much information upfront to streamline conversations. That way, everyone gets value out of the partnership.\nFinancial compensation is important, but so is crediting and celebrating Black creatives. Giving credit can look different depending on the project. Often it means using your platform to elevate Black creativity. One brand that actively seeks to credit both Black creators and Black businesses is Target. In a recent series called Convos with CEOs, Target partnered with YouTube Creator Hallease to highlight the stories behind the CEOs of four different Black-owned brands at Target. With over an hour of original content, the campaign garnered 6.4 million views, 20% higher than benchmarks.\nWhile it\u2019s great to use February as a time to prioritize these initiatives, investing in broad and systemic representation of creators should be a year-round effort. To make good on promises to drive equity, brands must embed it into the DNA of their businesses. And that means scouting, paying, and crediting Black creators."

        "output": "Brands are embracing multiformat video as a key marketing strategy, whether they\u2019re exploring how personal relevance influences watching habits across formats or thinking like creators and experimenting with short- and long-form content. And with 80% of viewers agreeing that YouTube offers the largest variety of video content compared to any other platform,1 brands are turning to the platform to bring their campaigns to life across different formats and environments.\nSource: Google/Kantar, U.S., YouTube U.S. Hero Claims 2022, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop viewers of video content min. once/week, fieldwork completed in Q1 2022.\nWhile multiformat success often means matching your creative asset with the right screen and content type, it\u2019s also critically important to use video formats that are geared toward your marketing goals. Here, we\u2019ll break down what this means in practice by looking at three case studies about brands that combined multiple video formats with cutting-edge creative to drive powerful results.\nNissan wanted to build awareness and excitement for its all-new, all-electric vehicle, Ariya, in a thrilling way. Knowing that music offers a deeply personal, yet universal, experience, the brand dreamed up unique ways to leverage the art form. Since YouTube offers a breadth of ways for music fans to tap into their passions, the marketing team tapped into the platform to reach engaged audiences.\nTo fully demonstrate Ariya\u2019s duality \u2014 that of a serene, Japanese-inspired cabin combined with the thrilling torque of an electric vehicle \u2014 Nissan opted to experiment with YouTube\u2019s popular lo-fi trend, consisting of music videos with chill hip-hop beats and stripped-back production.\nInspired by a popular creator called Lofi Girl, Nissan created its own four-hour lo-fi video, complete with a 15-track playlist and whimsical animation. While creating hourslong content might be considered risky, Nissan felt confident that YouTube viewers would be receptive. As Allyson Witherspoon, Nissan\u2019s global CMO, explains, \u201cIn launching the all-electric Ariya, we looked to build awareness and consideration in ways that could match the vehicle in being exceptionally creative, unique, and trend-leading. That\u2019s where YouTube came in. It gave us the creative canvas to innovate and authentically connect with our audience.\u201d\nNissan ran its lo-fi video across screens using skippable in-stream ads to drive efficient reach, along with a roadblock on Lofi Girl\u2019s channel to increase the video\u2019s share of voice. The team also used a diverse mix of music lineups to surround the campaign with related content, engage new audiences, and meet passionate music lovers already primed for listening across screens.\nIn its first month, the video drew over 7 million views and thousands of positive comments. It earned an impressive average watch time of 15 minutes across all devices, and 19 minutes on connected TV (CTV) specifically. The campaign\u2019s impact proves that with the right creative, the right trend, and the right platform, even the longest-form content can engage audiences across screens.\nInternational fitness brand Les Mills had the goal of increasing sign ups for its Les Mills+ at-home fitness app. To achieve it, the brand sought to make exercise \u2014 an intimidating concept for many consumers \u2014 feel more accessible. This made short, made-for-mobile video the ideal format. And, with YouTube Shorts averaging over 50 billion daily views (as of January 2023),2 Les Mills put Shorts at the center of its plan.\nFor ad creative, the brand repurposed short-form, vertical video content previously developed for social media. Next, the Les Mills team ran a mix of vertical and horizontal Video action campaigns to encourage lower-funnel audiences to sign up for the Les Mills+ app. This approach ensured that viewers would receive the most suitable aspect ratio, regardless of device.\nUltimately, the campaign exceeded expectations by generating a 52% increase in click-through rate, while reducing cost; Les Mills saw a 10% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 16% decrease in cost per impression. And, while people tuned in on a variety of devices, 24% of impressions were generated from views on mobile phones, supporting the team\u2019s strategy to build with mobile in mind.\nAs Michael Fitzpatrick, marketing manager at Les Mills, explains, \u201cIncorporating vertical video has enabled us to reach incremental audiences during their different watch states and, ultimately, drive more people to work out with us on Les Mills+.\u201d His team\u2019s successful approach shows that using multiple formats helps marketers meet customers where they\u2019re consuming content and drive the results they seek.\nFor centuries, winery brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has been known for its prestigious, high-end Champagne. More recently, however, the company has sought to increase brand desirability by expanding its core audience. For the marketing team, this meant a rejuvenation of brand content, with a modern twist. Taking a cue from the popular how-to trend on YouTube, they created The Perfect Serve, a tutorial series aimed at making Champagne culture appeal to a new generation.\nThis series included long-form videos, along with shorter, bite-sized teaser videos. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s creative best practices, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon designed its shorter videos to run as attention-grabbing in-stream ads to attract viewers to its \u201cThe Perfect Serve\u201d YouTube playlist.\nWith creative assets ready, the team considered screens. Since reaching people in multiple watching environments was important, they made a bold choice to run two different campaigns; one meant for viewers specifically streaming YouTube on their CTVs and another that focused on all other devices.\nWhile the two campaigns used the same creative assets, the CTV campaign helped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon marry its engaging tutorials with a screen designed to be immersive and proved to be effective. According to our recent study with Latitude, viewers agree that ads on YouTube CTV are more relevant (59%), unique (55%), informative (52%), and enjoyable (51%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3\nBoth campaigns performed exceptionally well, but the CTV effort was the most successful with viewers. Compared to the campaign targeting other devices, it drove more than double the ad recall, demonstrating how brands can use CTV to bolster their media strategies and connect with passionate audiences.\n\u201cThe emergence of CTV on YouTube shows us how message and format are intrinsically linked,\u2019\u2019 says Karen Valesella, digital marketing and communications director at Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u2018\u2019Whether it\u2019s very short or very long formats, YouTube offers us a wide range of possibilities to meet all our needs.\u201d Citing its impressive results, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has incorporated CTV into the brand\u2019s broader strategy.\nNissan took a chance on a four-hour lo-fi video to drive excitement for its electric vehicle, while Les Mills successfully increased sign-ups with short-form fitness content. And Mo\u00ebt & Chandon experimented with different formats to boost their brand appeal, ultimately striking gold with their CTV campaign. These campaigns proved how multiformat videos on YouTube can help brands tell their stories and reach the world\u2019s largest video-viewing audience at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way."

        "output": "YouTube is the top streaming destination for viewers of all generations. Senior leaders from media agency Carat share how brands should approach the platform to connect with audiences and drive results.\nAs people of all generations spend less time watching TV1 and more time online,2 it\u2019s increasingly clear that YouTube is now their top choice among streaming and social platforms.3\nViewers come to YouTube for many reasons: to immerse themselves in their favorite worlds through deep-dive content, to catch a new video from their favorite creator, or to find in-depth commentary and analysis. A top reason audiences tune into the No. 1 most-watched streaming platform in America4 is to rewind relevant events5 and discover thoughtful perspectives in a media environment that sometimes sacrifices depth for velocity. This is according to recent research on viewer trends from media agency Carat, youth culture agency Archrival, and Google.\nThis same study demonstrated two other noteworthy insights. First, audiences appreciate having the agency to search for and choose YouTube videos that bring them joy.6 They\u2019re not just passing time watching the latest trends served up on social media. Instead, they consider the minutes and hours on YouTube to be time well spent. Second, a majority of viewers agree that creators are the reason they visit YouTube. This is especially true of Gen Z.7\nThese insights reinforce YouTube\u2019s indispensability to users and present a huge opportunity for advertisers to increase engagement with their audiences. For more on YouTube\u2019s place in viewers\u2019 lives and its significance to advertisers, we asked three agency executives from Carat to share their perspective on how brands can make the most of the unique engagement and relevance that YouTube offers.\nYouTube enables us to place people at the heart of our media approach. The platform offers powerful opportunities for brands to understand the behaviors, preferences, and cultural trends of their target audiences and then use those insights to map consumer journeys and optimize campaign performance at every stage.\nWe know, for instance, that YouTube has unparalleled influence among Gen Z viewers and that 68% of Gen Z audiences agree creators are why they keep returning to YouTube.8 This creator-driven content lets brands establish authentic connections with their audiences, inspire action, and achieve sustained growth.\nYouTube is a launchpad for myriad ideas, making it a valuable platform for brands. Users trust YouTube to provide answers and inspiration; it\u2019s the starting point and endpoint of their online experience.\nYouTube\u2019s large creator community and crowdsourcing aspects contribute to the wealth of content available and provide diverse opportunities for consumer engagement. By tapping into thoughtful perspectives, curating time well spent, and fostering creator connections, we guide brands to make the most of YouTube\u2019s unique engagement and opportunities for relevance. We ensure that brands show up where viewers have always been watching, reflecting what truly matters to them.\nPeople go to YouTube to engage with topics they are passionate about and search for different perspectives. Core users will go even deeper than casual users, journeying through the platform for a variety of opinions. YouTube is not just entertainment for them; it broadens how they see the world and think about key issues.\nYouTube\u2019s role in the media ecosystem has started to shift. As connected TV has started to feel more traditional and social media has become unpredictable, YouTube now seems to sit in a sweet spot between the two. YouTube offers users more control and searchability than social platforms, but the content still feels fresh, unconstrained by the rigid formats associated with TV. Brands should lean into these strengths. By doing so, they can still drive reach within topics of interest, maintain the freedom to play with format, and offer unique perspectives audiences can\u2019t get elsewhere."

        "output": "The final weeks of the year provide a natural opportunity to reflect on the world around us and plan for the future. As 2021 has been another year of change driven by disruptive external events, the year\u2019s top videos \u2014 viewed by 2 billion people across more than 100 countries \u2014 reflect that reality.\nYouTube\u2019s Culture and Trends team reviewed the top videos from creators from around the globe and saw three themes emerge \u2014 community, comfort, and creativity \u2014 that offer a glimpse into what people are watching and what 2022 might hold. Together these themes not only encapsulate where we are today, but speak to broader shifts in society. From a marketing standpoint, these global insights can help brands understand what people are looking for and how best to reach them.\n\u201cGaming\u201d used to be a subculture, but with 2.9 billion people expected to play video games by the end of this year, today it\u2019s clearly pop culture. The $175 billion industry also has a diverse consumer base, with women making up 46% of gamers and 10% of gamers identifying as LGBTQ+.\nGaming\u2019s primacy is reflected in this year\u2019s Top 10 lists. Players from around the world have taken gaming to the next level, using game elements to craft narratives that spark viewer obsession akin to a must-see TV series. YouTube\u2019s most viewed game, \u201cMinecraft,\u201d featured prominently in two of the top trending videos, receiving more than 100 million combined views. YouTube\u2019s most viewed new game, a rhythm game called \u201cFriday Night Funkin\u201d that\u2019s reminiscent of early 2000s craze \u201cDance Dance Revolution,\u201d made the list with an entry from Cory Kenshin. And speaking of nostalgia, another dominant video, Game Night Stereotypes from top creators Dude Perfect, hilariously portrays a cast of characters often encountered playing board games.\nSource: Newzoo, Global Games Market to Generate $175.8 Billion in 2021; Despite a Slight Decline, the Market Is on Track to Surpass $200 Billion in 2023, May 6, 2021.\nFor many creators and viewers, engaging with game content offers a way to engage with each other, whether through live streaming or on their own time. With the huge cultural zeitgeist around gaming, marketers are finding creative ways to tap into this community. Nintendo debuted its new OLED model, highlighting different games and ways to play, earning a spot on the 2021 end-of-year YouTube ads leaderboard. Among other brand integrations, Balenciaga collaborated with Fortnite, Lil Nas X performed for Roblox, and Puma and ColourPop partnered with Animal Crossing.\nThe past two years have been defined by global political and social instability with little ability to guess the future beyond next week. Perhaps in response to this extended period of uncertainty, people around the world engaged in comfort viewing by seeking out the familiar.\nFor instance, some of this year\u2019s top trending videos from around the world are newer versions of videos that previously resonated with viewers. Back by popular demand, Sidemen created a third installment of their \u201cTinder in Real Life\u201d series, while Mark Rober reprised his 2020 backyard squirrel maze with an even more challenging obstacle course.\nJust as familiar content brings a sense of comfort, so does comedy. Many of 2021\u2019s most popular comedy videos centered on relatable, true-to-life events. This video from Canadian creator Jeenie.Weenie, one in a series about her experience as a flight attendant dealing with different types of passengers, has more than 8 million views.\nOther top videos provided a comic twist on the journalistic interview format. Two students interviewed German rapper Shirin David about her lyrics, and U.K. creator Niko Omilana cleverly convinced BBC News to interview him, while also encouraging people to vote. Taking note of the types of content people are engaging with and looking for \u2014 both comfort and comedy \u2014 can help marketers meet consumers where they are with messages that resonate, which is important in times of uncertainty.\nWhereas audiences have embraced long-form videos on familiar themes, short-form video has become a laboratory for new storytelling formats. Hybrid creators who produce YouTube Shorts alongside their long-form videos have illustrated how quick bites can give audiences a novel experience. Chef Nick DiGiovanni\u2019s long-form videos resemble the food content trend that dominated the first 20 years of this century. But his short-form recipes rely on a quirkier, more playful editing style. By creating for both formats, Nick can bake his cake and eat it too.\nSome creators \u2014 like Chingu amiga, a Korean woman living in Mexico \u2014 use short-form videos to highlight cultural nuances. And others share motivational messages and interesting facts. We see this with Indian creator A2 Motivation, whose bite-sized videos and channel have collectively garnered over 6 billion views. By giving us another view of their worlds, Shorts offer an expanded way for creators to connect with audiences.\nFor marketers, sometimes short and sweet works well, whether that\u2019s giving people a look behind the scenes or demonstrating a new way to use your product. Japanese restaurant Horumon Shimata went viral with a warning video showing that dangerously hot car temperatures are capable of cooking raw meat. The brand regularly posts behind-the-scenes food videos that subtly promote the restaurant to diners.\nAs we reflected on 2021, themes of community, comfort, and creativity popped up repeatedly in the videos YouTubers around the world chose to watch. These are not fleeting trends, but broader indicators of the kinds of content consumers need and the creators they love. Marketers who embrace these themes in their video and ad creative will evolve with their viewers and connect with key audiences in the moments that matter."

        "input": "",
        "output": "David Mataranglo is the U.S. CEO at Reprise Digital, a performance marketing company. Here, he shares how to create an agile business that\u2019s ready to tackle today\u2019s challenges and be prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow by focusing your marketing on customer behaviors.\nClosing out this calendar year, businesses are likely realizing that uncertainty is the only certainty. A parade of headlines \u2014 covering labor shortages, supply chain delays, inflation, and uncertain financial markets \u2014 dominate the news and suggest that volatility will persist. As a result, changes in consumer behavior will likely continue, sending a clear signal to brands: Adapt or be left behind.\nAt Reprise Digital, we help ensure that the brands we work with are agile and ready for whatever the future holds. We do this by focusing on how consumers move along the path to purchase, and analyzing and assessing those behaviors holistically, rather than in siloed channels. This approach allows brands to design their marketing around consumer behaviors, which positions them to thrive, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nA great example of this is the work we\u2019ve done with dermocosmetic skin care brand NEOSTRATA and its e-commerce strategy.\nOperating a direct-to-consumer business model, the company sought to efficiently drive traffic and online sales despite having limited awareness. In partnership with Reprise, NEOSTRATA piloted a new approach using Performance Max, which leverages automation to optimize Google and YouTube campaigns in real time. More specifically, this helped the brand hit its predetermined goals by identifying the right ad creative and the right ad placement to reach the customers most likely to convert.\nThe campaign\u2019s results speak for themselves: When comparing three months of Performance Max data to the previous three months of standard Shopping campaigns, NEOSTRATA saw a 91% increase in revenue at a 65% increase in spend, all while increasing efficiency 16%.\nWhile every brand is unique and will see different results, you can follow this example \u2014 and deliver consumer-centric marketing while staying agile \u2014 by employing three key steps. First, enhance your first-party data strategy. Then use automation to optimize your marketing for the right customers. And finally, build a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience.\nAs the economy tightens, many brands are tempted to shift their advertising focus to performance and results. With increased scrutiny on ROI, marketing teams will need to work smarter, using data to achieve greater scale and better outcomes without sacrificing effectiveness. This requires having a sustainable first-party data strategy in place.\nFirst-party data can create new value for your marketing, improve ad performance, and help you deepen relationships with your customers. To build a strong strategy, it\u2019s critical to know exactly what data you need to collect from customers and have a clear plan for how it will be used. For example, NEOSTRATA identified its website visitors, particularly those who did not make a purchase, as a crucial audience to help drive the highest quality leads.\nAs you develop your strategy, keep in mind that value exchange is paramount. You must give your customers something of value in return for their consented data, such as early access to new product launches, personalized recommendations, exclusive products, and other unique offers.\nIn times of volatility, brands should shift their focus away from generalized outcomes, like the number of clicks, toward customers who are the most valuable and profitable. And because customer journeys are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to measure, leveraging automation is increasingly important.\nWith automation, it\u2019s possible to focus your campaign reach on those online customers who are most likely to shop with your brand. Tools like Performance Max, for instance, allow you to promote products across a range of channels, and ensure that you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. This capability becomes even more powerful when you\u2019re able to combine it with first-party data you\u2019ve collected and build lists of people who may be interested in your products.\nAutomation becomes even more significant when you factor in nuances like fluctuating demand across markets, because it can keep pace with shifting consumer behavior faster than a manual, human-led process. In this way, automation can be a particularly vital device for keeping your business agile and ready to react to changes in real time.\nWe certainly saw this with NEOSTRATA. Using Performance Max, the marketing team was able to optimize their Google Shopping feed, regularly rotate ad copy and collateral, and develop a complete set of audience signals, like website visitors and purchases used to target new customers. And all of this was done at scale and across new formats like video, which is crucial for driving conversions across a full-funnel strategy.\nIncreasingly, brands need to think beyond in-store versus online, linear versus digital marketing, or mid-funnel versus lower-funnel conversions and embrace a more connected, omnichannel customer experience. Indeed, a recent survey by McKinsey found that 75% of U.S. consumers say they\u2019re going both online and into stores to research and buy products across categories.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? A fully connected customer experience collapses the traditional marketing funnel and authentically reflects how people are actually shopping today. For example, people increasingly use the internet to discover new products and often end up buying products immediately after researching them. So what has traditionally been an upper-funnel activity is now also a purchasing opportunity through various shoppable media. This means that every connection you make is a chance to acquire a new customer.\nDuring the past couple of years, NEOSTRATA focused on expanding their approach from selling products mainly in dermatology offices to selling directly to consumers. That meant the brand needed to create experiences that make it easier for customers to convert throughout the funnel, whether they were comparing different skin care products through Search or discovering the brand for the first time on YouTube. In fact, combining search and video is especially important, as research shows that YouTube advertisers see brand videos driving 28% of their conversion assists.1\nAmid a volatile economic forecast, it\u2019s more important than ever for your businesses to adapt and stay agile. You can set yourself up for success by developing a smart first-party data strategy, leveraging automation to find the most valuable customers and creating a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience. With these tactics, your business can drive growth now and capitalize on new opportunities in the future."

        "output": "A version of this article first appeared on the YouTube Blog on February 27, 2023.\nEquity and inclusion are at the forefront of YouTube\u2019s mission. Upholding it means that our teams are constantly exploring how our norms, practices, and policies may inadvertently create bias and inequity on the platform.\nThis is why, in 2020, we established a dedicated Racial Justice, Equity, and Product Inclusion team to ensure that the voices of historically underrepresented communities were incorporated early into the development of our products and protocols. Since then, one of the team\u2019s core programs \u2014 called the Inclusion Working Group (IWG) \u2014 has played a critical role in embedding equity into YouTube\u2019s platform and business.\nWe created the IWG as a resource to help our employees consider key risks and opportunities during the development of new products, processes, and policies. It consists of a dedicated product inclusion lead, executive sponsors, employee resource group (ERG) representatives, and leaders from across YouTube \u2014 including experts in machine learning and responsible AI.\nWhile we have a long way to go, the IWG has been a significant step forward in YouTube\u2019s commitment to driving equality. We also acknowledge the power of sharing our progress, with the hope that it can help inspire others to tackle inequality with us, together.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re eager to share three key things that have helped the IWG succeed.\nBeing user first is core to everything we do at YouTube, and it\u2019s imperative that our users see themselves and their lived experiences reflected in our products and policies.\nDelivering on this requires teams to consider equity and inclusion early and often in the development process, so they have time to identify and mitigate risks, and adjust direction when necessary. The IWG makes this possible.\nThe group partners directly with teams to understand how they plan to use machine learning, whether facets of identity are considered in their products, whether new launches may lead to undue hate and harassment, and more.\nAlready, we\u2019ve seen the IWG\u2019s contributions help teams improve a range of projects and programs. For example, it directly influenced the creation of new safety protocols for the first-ever all-female broadcast of a Major League Baseball game last summer. The IWG also helped improve how we detect racially insensitive comments on YouTube, prepared our teams to better identify and respond to new forms of online hate, and provided constant advocacy for the safety and diverse representation of Creators in product launches.\nBy design, the IWG gets its strength from its members \u2014 a consultative, cross-functional team of professionals that span YouTube\u2019s product areas, varied ERGs, and its executive leadership.\nIn addition to its members\u2019 vast expertise and experience, executive sponsorship and buy-in are essential to formalize and champion the IWG\u2019s role. The group helps to mitigate risk and improve the overall quality of product launches by assembling voices from across multiple functions and underrepresented groups to consider questions of inclusion.\nTo date, the IWG has partnered with YouTube teams on over 900 projects. In 2023, the program will expand its coverage to 100% of YouTube\u2019s product teams and range of collaborators. It will also provide guidance on how to prioritize equity across product strategy and to increase visibility among teams. Additionally, the IWG will focus on educating teams by sharing learnings from case studies, research, frameworks, and other content to continue driving scalable ways of thinking equity-first.\nWhile this work will take time and thoughtful discussion, we are motivated by the ways it will benefit the entire YouTube ecosystem for years to come. We acknowledge there is much to do and look forward to sharing more of our progress as we continue this work."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Flying cars may have been a sign of the times on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d but in real life, electric vehicles (EVs) are ushering us into the future. Just as gas-powered engines replaced horse-drawn carts a century ago, EVs are disrupting the industry and setting the standard for the next hundred years of auto innovation.\nIn short, EVs are taking over. EV sales in the U.S. rose 62% in the first half of this year, and now make up 5% of new car sales. While this may sound small, it actually marks a tipping point for EV adoption. The shift to EVs could also accelerate rapidly, as drivers are still feeling squeezed by higher gas prices. In fact, searches for \u201cbest gas mileage\u201d are growing globally by 90% year over year.1 And, according to industry analysts, about 45% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.\nThese numbers have helped automakers see the EV light. They\u2019re investing over $526 billion in an all-electric future, which includes building new assembly lines and parts, learning to produce and store batteries, and preparing for changing tax implications.\nBut is their marketing keeping pace too? As brands work to get EVs in the hands of consumers, many auto marketers are still relying on an outdated playbook. Here are three ways they can rethink stale strategies and make their EV marketing as electric as their vehicles.\nAn avalanche of EVs is coming, leading to a crowded marketplace. The 2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Car Wars report projects that by 2026, 60% of the new models launched will be electric or hybrid.2 And more models mean more choices for auto shoppers.\nIn addition to a crowded market, automakers will also have to contend with the fact that EV models do not have the same level of brand recognition that gas-powered vehicles do. Indeed, 1 in 4 consumer searches for EVs are unbranded.3\nThis means automakers need to build brand recognition for new vehicles now to be well positioned and top of mind when EV options increase for shoppers. One way to achieve this is through video ads that can differentiate a brand\u2019s EV from the competition by touting its unique selling points. In our studies, we found that 80% of new auto purchasers took an action after watching a video,4 such as searching online for more information, visiting a dealer website, scheduling a test drive, or creating custom specifications for a new vehicle online.\nTo see how high consumer interest in EVs is, you only need to look online, where searches for EVs are accelerating. People are also looking for more detailed information about EVs, which suggests they might be heading further into the consideration phase. For example, while searches for \u201celectric vehicle\u201d have grown 87% year over year globally,5 more detailed searches like \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d have also grown by 80%.6 And searches for \u201cbest electric cars 2022\u201d have grown in the U.S. by over 5,000% year over year.7\nThis gives brands the opportunity to meet people in search results and answer their most common questions and concerns. This in turn will help brands become a major part of customers\u2019 path to purchase, guiding them every step of the way. But which search subjects should brands focus on?\nAccording to Gearshift, the most researched topics by people interested in EVs are general explorations of EV or hybrid vehicles, vehicle charging information, maintenance, and environmental benefits.8 And notably, the top two concerns that prevent people from considering EVs are anxieties over vehicle charging or range and other technological issues.9\nPotential EV customers may be at an all-time high for consideration, but they\u2019re very unsure about making the final purchase. Most potential buyers are undecided on whether or not to buy an electric car, and most of them won\u2019t end up converting.10 In the end, just 33% of new U.S. car buyers who considered a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle bought one.11\nApproaching hesitant buyers with outdated marketing tactics and a one-size-fits-all message probably won\u2019t make much of a dent, especially since the EV market is evolving so rapidly. Brands must be able to zig as customers zag and deliver tailored messaging to varying customer segments with different needs and concerns.\nTo do this at scale, brands should use automation and machine learning to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time. The real-time data from automated campaigns can also help brands learn more about potential customers and easily tweak their messaging to increase its effectiveness. By using these modern marketing tools, brands can convince hesitant buyers to choose a vehicle of the future.\nAs consideration and sales of EVs rapidly increase, automakers can set themselves up for success by using video to differentiate their brand and EV models from the competition, appearing in EV search results to answer customer questions, and leveraging automation to deliver the right message to a wide range of consumers.

        "output": "Whether it\u2019s pressing the reset button or discovering new cultures, travel can be a restorative and inspiring experience. But for many LGBTQ+ travelers, it comes with underlying stresses.\nBoth during the planning stage and on the trip itself, they can feel forced to hide their authentic selves. Traditional booking touchpoints, such as the research phase or checking in at the chosen accommodation \u2014 which should be part of the fun \u2014 become a source of anxiety.\nAmon Versteeg, senior director of business marketing at Booking.com, knows from personal experience what this is like. So he worked closely with his team to introduce the Travel Proud program, which helps to make travel a safer, more enjoyable experience for the LGBTQ+ community.\nWith hospitality defined as \u201cthe friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers,\u201d feeling welcome is an intrinsic part of the customer experience. And when it comes to creating inclusive hospitality, Booking.com\u2019s motto is \u201cyou can\u2019t truly experience the world if you only show up as half of yourself.\u201d\nThis underscores what prompted the birth of Travel Proud \u2014 \u200b\u200ba training and certification initiative for the hospitality industry to ensure the LGBTQ+ community can travel safely and experience the full joy of travel, no matter who they love or how they identify.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ community is not accustomed to being 100% themselves. Over time and over history, we\u2019ve learned to suppress a part of who we are,\u201d Versteeg explains.\nThis means that LGBTQ+ people tend to travel with what Versteeg describes as a \u201cdetective mindset,\u201d constantly searching for clues as to whether they will truly be welcome at their chosen destination, even if it is advertised as inclusive tourism.\nVersteeg\u2019s aha! moment came when he was planning a safari with friends, and they found an incredible ecotourism site. He checked an LGBTQ+ inclusive lodging directory, found the lodge there, and excitedly told his friends.\n\u201cMy friend didn\u2019t understand why this was important, so I explained I didn\u2019t want to get to the middle of the safari and find out there would be an issue with my husband and I. My friend then said we\u2019d just have to tell them we were brothers if that happened.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s not innate to everyone to think about this. It still grounds me.\u201d\nTo better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ travelers, Booking.com conducted a survey to gauge the community\u2019s lived experiences. It revealed that more than half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had a less than welcoming travel experience.\nThis includes situations that are not necessarily intentional but can make people feel unwelcome or stressed while on vacation. For example, 20% of those surveyed had staff assume they would need separate rooms or beds when checking in as a couple, while 1 in 5 have felt the need to change their behavior \u2014 and 16% to change their appearance \u2014 to avoid judgment or awkward interactions with accommodation staff or owners.\nVersteeg\u2019s team also identified keywords and feelings from each travel touchpoint, such as researching where to stay, the actual process of booking (for example, does the property booking page use gendered or binary terms only), the arrival at the property, and their experience during their stay.\nThe results were striking. \u201cA word that repeatedly came up throughout the journey, from research through to check-in at accommodation, was \u2018caution.\u2019 And it soon became clear that \u2018safe\u2019 means \u2018good.\u2019 And at the end of the journey the emotion is \u2018relief,\u2019\u201d says Versteeg.\n\u201cFor example, when someone in our trans community is checking into accommodation, and they provide identification with a gender different to how they\u2019re presenting: This is a huge moment,\u201d Versteeg explains. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for companies to really show what welcoming looks like. Whether it\u2019s avoiding gendered pronouns or knowing that it\u2019s OK to ask what your guest prefers. That can have a huge impact.\u201d\nTravel Proud seeks to address this issue. Property owners who host on Booking.com receive coaching from Hospitable Me, which specializes in diversity and inclusion training for the hospitality industry. This training guides property owners on how they can make their venue more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ travelers, and provides tools to grow awareness and understanding. In turn, they will be featured as an inclusive destination on the Booking.com site.\nAs well as the number of venues that signed up to the program (10,000 and counting), Versteeg notes that he was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of properties that are now listed through Travel Proud, from small one-off rural destinations to major venues. \u201cIn a short time, we already surpassed 10,000 properties achieving the Proud Certified standard in our key focus markets.\u201d\nTravel Proud is a big part of Booking.com\u2019s work to deliver more authentic experiences to travelers. For LGBTQ+ travelers specifically, Versteeg states the need to challenge the meaning of what good travel means. \u201cUltimately, a good experience should be more than a safe experience. When we hold a mirror up, we ask \u2018Have we done this for everyone?\u2019\u201d\nFor other companies wishing to make similar strides, Versteeg advises starting small: \u201cFocus on understanding what would make a difference in your organization, and then turn it into many small steps. See it as a continuous journey rather than a destination.\u201d"

Eighty-nine percent of marketing decision-makers agree that leadership is raising the pressure on them to demonstrate ROI, according to research that Google recently commissioned with Kantar.1\nAs a result, finding effective ways to assess how well your advertising works, while remaining privacy-conscious, is more important than ever. In this environment, how can you be confident when making decisions that set up your business for growth?\nAI-powered solutions can strengthen confidence and deliver better outcomes, all in a privacy-safe way. But to get the most from these solutions, you need to lay the groundwork and get the essentials right. By building your first-party data strategy and setting up a privacy-first digital marketing foundation, you can unlock better measurement and effectively collaborate with AI to drive business results.\nTo deliver results today and drive sustainable growth tomorrow, focus on these four key areas.\nPrivacy and performance aren\u2019t at odds. AI-powered solutions enable you to balance the two and unlock advantages for your business.

This requires thoughtfully communicating with your customers when gathering consent about how you do and don\u2019t use their data. Research suggests that a proactive approach to privacy can give marketers a significant leg up with consumers.\nIn a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 49% of respondents said a positive privacy experience with a second-choice brand would convince them to choose that brand over a preferred brand.2\nOnce you\u2019ve built a durable foundation of first-party data, you can unlock more accurate measurement and gain a clearer view of the customer journey.

Next, it joined the brand\u2019s online and offline data to better understand the customer journey. Within 10 months, Calendly had a full-funnel view of its highest-value prospects and customers. Furthermore, this site-tagging implementation helped the marketing team convince leadership to invest in long-term data and measurement infrastructure. As Jessica Gilmartin, CMO of Calendly, shares, \u201cby connecting Google AI to our product and customer data, we\u2019ve been able to prove the ROI of our marketing investments to our executive team. It\u2019s completely changed the game for us.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve made gains in first-party data collection, AI-powered solutions like modeling, predictive targeting, and analytics can inform your measurement strategy \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have user-level data. This fusion of innovation and privacy will help you take your business to the next level while being responsible stewards of people\u2019s data.\nPrivacy-first data collection is only the first step. A natural follow-on opportunity is to use AI-powered insights to better understand what\u2019s working well. For example, the Insights page in Google Ads uses AI to help you predict rising search trends, understand performance changes, and uncover new audiences that may not conform to your typical customer profile. Insights like these give you an alternate view of your customers\u2019 characteristics and behaviors \u2014 including ad engagements \u2014 so you can connect with them in more meaningful ways.\nSearch agency Solutions 8 used Google AI to uncover surprising insights on behalf of a food industry client. Solutions 8 ran a Performance Max campaign for its client, a producer of shelf-stable food products marketed to a particular type of customer, namely \u201cdoomsday preppers.\u201d Thanks to the Insights page in Google Ads, the agency soon learned that audiences with an interest in boating and sailing significantly outperformed the client\u2019s traditional audience. With that knowledge, it created assets for this previously unrealized customer segment and started a new campaign for the sailing audience.\nBy combining first-party data with insights, marketers can take decisive actions that lead to improved ROI and business outcomes.\nGoogle AI can help you achieve more precise campaign performance by predicting future consumer behavior and constantly optimizing to your KPIs.\nFor example, German online retailer Baur turned to Google Analytics 4 predictive audiences for a recent Google Ads campaign. By targeting an audience of likely purchasers, it achieved sales growth of 56% and an increase in conversion rate of 87%. In fact, Baur calculated that 70% of these customers could only be reached using these predictive audiences in Google Ads.\nYou can also use audience and performance data to inform AI-based solutions that maximize results over time. Take Smart Bidding, which uses Google AI to optimize your bids in every auction and increase conversions based on your goals. Using Smart Bidding, the French automobile brand Citro\u00ebn saw a 16% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) by implementing a value-based bid strategy.\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. We encourage you to adopt an iterative mindset so you can operate as confidently as possible. A spirit of experimentation will validate that your measurement and our AI powered solutions are working in a world with fewer individual identifiers.\nFor instance, advertisers who use marketing mix models (MMM) should use experiments to calibrate those models. A single experiment may be sufficient to effectively modify your MMM. When Google commissioned Nielsen to use NCSolutions\u2019 sales-lift results to calibrate its mix models, the revenue and ROAS attributed to YouTube increased 84% on average.\nThe majority of that volume was previously attributed to base variables (brand distribution and pricing), thus reallocating that volume to YouTube improved marketing results overall.\nBy directly validating what\u2019s working, you\u2019ll be able to combine your own learnings with Google AI to enable more accurate measurement and deliver results for your business.\nWe\u2019re at a critical moment in our industry. Our goal at Google is to give you confidence that your first-party data foundation, audience modeling, and measurement setup are all working hard to deliver results for you. With AI-powered tools at your fingertips, you can rest assured that you\u2019re building the most effective and cost-efficient measurement strategies possible while respecting the privacy of your customers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In preparation for the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Adrienne Hayes, Google\u2019s VP of marketing for global devices and services, spoke with Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD\u2019s president and CEO, about why LGBTQ inclusion in marketing and media is good for business. Hayes is also a GLAAD board member and serves as global executive sponsor of Google\u2019s LGBTQ employee resource group.\nIn recent years, companies have increasingly recognized the value that diverse, inclusive, and equitable marketing practices bring to their brands. For marketers, this has been deeply clarifying. Every creative choice we make has the power to shape how we see each other. Inherent in that responsibility is an incredible opportunity: to create work that positively and authentically reflects the world.\nWhile historically excluded from advertising, the LGBTQ community in the U.S. has seen positive movement toward greater inclusion and diversity in brand marketing and increasing acceptance by the general public. A report published last December by GLAAD \u2014 the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer media advocacy organization \u2014 and the Edelman Trust Institute found that Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding LGBTQ rights.\nAlong with this momentum, however, there have been plenty of setbacks. Marketers in the U.S. are likely familiar, for instance, with recent backlash experienced by one major retailer for displaying Pride Month merchandise, and the scrutiny experienced by a major brewing and beverage company after partnering with a transgender influencer. These mixed signals \u2014 rising consumer support on the one hand, push back on the other \u2014 can leave brands unsure of their own inclusive marketing plans.\nSo what does the data actually say about people\u2019s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and what should brands be doing \u2014 with confidence \u2014 to honor their inclusive marketing commitments?\nGLAAD recently released two studies that can be instructive. Its ninth annual Accelerating Acceptance study, which examines acceptance and attitudes toward LGBTQ Americans, showed that a record number of non-LGBTQ Americans support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. Support is quite literally at an all-time high. But an analysis of representation in advertising tells a different story.\nThis month, GLAAD\u2019s Advertising Visibility Index \u2014 an inaugural research report offering a data-backed reality check on LGBTQ representation in U.S. advertising, along with prescriptive guidance for brands \u2014 indicated that the LGBTQ community\u2019s size is not accurately reflected in ads and that current methods of inclusion are not always apparent to consumers. The takeaway is that there is room for improvement for the vast majority of brands.\nRecently, I sat down with Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO at GLAAD, to discuss the two studies and identify actions that marketers can take today to make their marketing more inclusive.\nSarah Kate Ellis: Our findings are really significant for marketers. For instance, we found that 3 out of 4 non-LGBTQ adults feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, which seems to validate that the backlash to inclusive ad campaigns really is coming from a small, though loud, number of activists. Inclusion is not only good for the bottom line, but when consumers are exposed to LGBTQ people and their lives in the media, that exposure has a profound impact on shifting culture and changing sentiments. Sixty percent of non-LGBTQ adults agree that seeing LGBTQ people in ads make them more comfortable with people who are different than themselves.1 So inclusion actually creates a more accepting society.\nEllis: Yes. We\u2019ve seen influencers and celebrities increasingly used in brand advertising, in general, and over 70% of inclusive ads we studied featured LGBTQ celebrities.2 But here\u2019s what is interesting: When it comes to LGBTQ representation, inclusion of an LGBTQ celebrity is the least important factor for consumers, LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ. What they\u2019re actually looking for are displays of empathy and humanity, followed by realistic storylines, like families sharing meals or couples holding hands.3 People want to see the everyday, human stuff. It\u2019s realistic stories over celebrity endorsement.\nEllis: While it\u2019s distressingly loud, it\u2019s actually far from the norm. Only 17% of consumers say seeing LGBTQ representation in brand advertising would make them feel more negatively about a brand. And only 16% of consumers say they would be less likely to purchase that brand\u2019s products or services.4 At a time when 1 in 5 Gen Zers in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, the calls for inclusion will continue to grow and be louder than the critics.\nSo negativity exists, but it\u2019s a really small portion of people who feel that way. Inclusive marketing is everywhere, and just because a few brands get called out by a loud minority, does not mean that inclusive marketing will end. While the headlines focused on a few brands that tried to appease critics by changing Pride campaigns, so many other brands stood their ground and that supposed backlash faded.\nEllis: Absolutely. We posed all of these questions about LGBTQ representation, and while we know it\u2019s become both more common in some circles, it\u2019s become more contentious. But what was unexpected was that a lot of people aren\u2019t even noticing LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly two-thirds of consumers believe LGBTQ representation is explicit enough to be noticed by most people, but less than 40% of consumers noticed the representation in LGBTQ inclusive Super Bowl ads.5 So even when it\u2019s happening, people aren\u2019t always aware of it.\nEllis: Well, for starters, this is bigger than marketing. Seventy percent of non-LGBTQ consumers want companies to show public support not just in advertising but in sponsorships and hiring as well.6\nBeyond that, I think the biggest takeaway for me is the idea that representation means more than existence, more than the old \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d model. Today, it\u2019s more about being an integral part of your community. We\u2019re your neighbors and your co-workers; we\u2019re in your congregation and in your family. We\u2019re part of the fabric of society, and marketers must show that. LGBTQ people have the same desires and needs as every other American. We buy cars and laundry detergent, and we worry about our kids and our bills just like everyone else. That\u2019s the story folks in the LGBTQ community want told, and it\u2019s the story that needs to be told.\nAt Google, we\u2019re always striving to increase representation, especially during big moments, but it\u2019s imperative this remains a focus year-round. These findings are a great reminder that our work is never done and that our approach to inclusive marketing can still be improved if we want to stay relevant now and in the future. For example, my team worked on Google Pixel\u2019s Super Bowl ad this year, which featured queer artist Doja Cat. GLAAD tested this ad as part of the Advertising Index, and a majority of consumers who viewed it didn\u2019t recognize any LGBTQ inclusion. It\u2019s on us, and fellow advertisers, to seize the opportunity to tell more realistic, human LGBTQ stories."

        "output": "We\u2019re in the middle of a third paradigm shift. The first shift was the arrival of the internet, with its revolution in information and services. The second was the explosion of mobile computing, driven by the adoption of smartphones. And today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to deliver transformations that are even more profound, for both consumers and businesses.\nKristen O\u2019Hara, VP of brand and agency solutions at Google, addresses a crowd of conference goers about the AI paradigm shift.\nAs with the internet and smartphones, the emergence of AI is a critical development for businesses. But how best to strategize? Naturally, it\u2019s important that we exercise caution in the face of uncertainty to mitigate potential risk. As with any powerful new tech, we must actively work to understand AI and its implications for our customers and marketing activities. Remember, we\u2019re not competing against AI, we\u2019re competing against businesses that are already using AI.\nThe good news: Chances are, you\u2019re already using AI. Here at Google, we\u2019ve been layering it into our products for years. From autocomplete in Search to captioning on YouTube to Translate\u2019s mastery of over 100 languages, our products have gotten steadily better as a direct result of this technology.\nEighty percent of marketers are already using at least one AI-powered Search ads product as a business multiplier right now.1 And tests have shown that advertisers who upgrade their exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns using a target cost per acquisition can see an average of 35% more conversions.2\nPerformance Max offers another useful example. With this product, advertisers bring their business objectives, first-party data, and some creative assets. Google AI will then optimize marketing campaigns across Search, YouTube, Discovery, Maps, and more, meeting customers wherever they are. Advertisers using Performance Max are seeing an 18% uplift in conversions, up 5% since last year, showing just how quickly Google\u2019s AI models are advancing.3\nPerformance Max is about to get even more powerful. We recently announced we\u2019re incorporating generative AI to make it even easier for advertisers to create custom assets and scale them in a few clicks. Just provide your website, and Google AI will learn about your brand, populating your campaign with text and other relevant assets. We\u2019ll even suggest new images generated just for you, helping you stand out to customers across a wide range of inventory and formats.\nWith the power of AI, we\u2019ll discover endless possibilities for creativity through direct collaboration and experimentation. Today, AI can help you write a form letter or optimize your media mix. Tomorrow, it may overhaul your creative workflows, freeing you up to solve entirely new creative and strategic challenges.\nFor example, AI is helping The New York Times organize 7 million photos from over 100 years of reporting. Working with Google Cloud, the Times has digitized its vast photo collection, which had been stored in hundreds of filing cabinets three stories below street level in a space called the \u201cmorgue.\u201d But digitally storing the pictures is only part of the story. To make the archive accessible and useful, the Times used AI to \u201cread\u201d the images, not only by scanning text in the images and notes written on the back but by recognizing objects and places in the photographs, preserving annotations, and making the archive searchable. Now Times journalists can use this resource to report stories rooted in deep historical context.\nGenerative AI is opening up even more possibilities, and we are rapidly moving to a world where the constraints on what you can create in digital spaces are limited only by your imagination.\nWhat will this mean for all of us as marketers? For one, the gap between coming up with a great idea and deploying that idea will shrink considerably. For example, the new Product Studio tool uses generative AI to help businesses of all sizes create a range of high-quality product imagery. Product Studio can create custom product scenes for seasonal or trending opportunities, remove distracting backgrounds, or even increase the resolution and sharpness of your product photos without having to go through expensive reshoots.\nThese are powerful technologies with consequences for individuals and organizations that are still not well understood. As we move boldly toward this future of creative possibility, we must take a responsible approach. We can\u2019t see around every corner, but we can anchor to principles, respond to challenges that arise, and partner with researchers, governments, and communities to ensure we get it right.\nI\u2019ve been asking myself and my team some tough questions as we navigate this third paradigm shift. Here are a few questions you can ask as your teams figure out how to harness the power of AI."

        "input": "",
        "output": "For years, marketers have been integrating AI-powered products into nearly every aspect of their work, gaining critical insights and driving more conversions with improved campaign optimizations.\nMore recently, the profusion of news surrounding generative AI has renewed the critical importance of the human in the driver\u2019s seat, especially when it comes to building advertising creative. Commercial creative would not exist without the talent behind it, full stop. And just as marketers have been using AI-powered tools, creatives have been experimenting with AI in everything from ads that talk back to concept decks that sing.\nWith responsive search ads (RSA) and responsive display ads (RDA), we\u2019ve already seen the ability of AI to optimize thoughtfully crafted assets into the best-performing combinations of creative. We know that AI can scale asset production to serve the most relevant version of an ad across channels via Performance Max, App, and Video action campaigns. Now, to get a pulse on how interdisciplinary creative teams are already exploring AI, we asked agency leads across three regions how they use it. Here\u2019s what they said.\nDuring the 2019 holiday season, a team tasked with selling the Google Nest to Australian shoppers had a unique opportunity to let people test the product from the comfort of their own homes.\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the experience of Nest into the ad itself, so that was the moonshot then \u2014 essentially, quite a while back before generative AI was a thing,\u201d said Tingyan Han, senior data strategy director, APAC at EssenceMediacom. \u201cWe needed to demonstrate the many ways in which Nest makes moments at home better.\u201d\nTo do that, the team turned to a speech-to-text API co-authored by Google with the help of the Google Nest and Google Media Lab teams.\n\u201cThere were many considerations when working with a speech-to-text API, from the UX to ad inventory and measurement, all the way down to testing whether local accents were recognizable,\u201d said Han. The ad would pause within the first few frames to allow the user time to opt in to the experience. When users said, \u201cHey Google, show me gingerbread house recipes,\u201d it would do as told.\nThe activation led to an increase in consideration to purchase. Vincent Tay, creative director, APAC at EssenceMediacom, says that\u2019s because the interactivity served to demonstrate the benefits of the product itself.\n\u201cWhile the thought of integrating new and shiny technology into every facet of our campaign can be alluring, we must always remember to place the human truth at its core,\u201d said Tay, who partnered with a UX/UR designer alongside Han on the campaign.\nMore recently, Publicis-owned Leo Burnett Australia used AI to build a talking car; Leo Burnett Taiwan used another kind of AI to celebrate Lunar New Year with potato chip-inspired fortunes.\n\u201cWe have been using Google Colab regularly for early prototyping efforts involving up-and-coming AI algorithms,\u201d said Laurent Thevenet, head of creative tech at Publicis covering APAC and MEA. \u201cWe are also starting to use Bard, as we like the fact that it is connected to the internet and can retrieve real-time information.\u201d\nIn addition to sending regular updates on emerging tech to its 4,000 creatives across the region, Publicis is also mentoring talent internally, sending mentees back to their respective agencies and teams with new knowledge.\n\u201cMachines need operators and, for the creative industry, it means that creatives will partner with machines, directing them towards the desired output,\u201d said Thevenet. \u201cThese creatives have to be hybrid talents able to think critically while having the ability to operate and connect these emerging AI systems with one another.\u201d\n\u201cImagine a concept store on the moon. What does that look like?\u201d\nEd Yeoman, creative director at London-based branding and design agency Human After All, has observed his team bringing AI into the ideation stage to collaborate on design fiction for this type of \u201cwild-card idea.\u201d\n\u201cSome people use it to get verbal prompts around language and messaging, and some people use it to get visual prompts to help them kind of imagine something that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d including events and event spaces, he said.\nGabriel Cheung, Global Executive Creative Director, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, says AI-generated content can also challenge teams to push their thinking. \u201cBecause of the way AI works with existing information, we let AI-powered tools quickly generate the \u2018first thought\u2019 ideas. Our thinking is that if AI can generate the same idea, then we haven\u2019t done our job well enough to come up with something new,\u201d said Cheung.\nGoogle recently announced a new conversational experience in Google Ads and Search campaigns that can be used to enhance brainstorms, a use case Yeoman\u2019s team found helpful.\n\u201c[The prompting] part of the process \u2026 puts you in the role of the creative or strategic director,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cOftentimes, at that level, you\u2019re helping to frame challenges for people to inspire them to do certain things. It\u2019s the same with AI. You\u2019re hoping to frame this challenge in a way which gives you an optimal output.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s announcement of the forthcoming addition of Adobe Firefly to Bard represents a commitment to ethical image generation. Firefly is trained on a catalog of hundreds of millions of licensed images in Adobe Stock. As private technology companies develop responsible AI and call for regulation, creative agencies are writing their own ethical guidelines.\n\u201cWe felt that there was a little bit of a lack of people talking about what it meant for humans,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cAt the heart of our business are the principles of empathy and reason. We try and build those into everything.\u201d\nEvery year, global creative agency Jellyfish Group invites its own technologists to a companywide hackathon. The participants invited to this year\u2019s event in Paris received a new kind of challenge: design an AI-powered solution for improving the quality and performance of creative assets. The event brought 120 technologists across data, media, and creative together to address this critical business need.\n\u201cThe benefit is huge; it elevates everyone\u2019s knowledge and experience, and that carries throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Sam Yates, chief solutions officer of creative technology at Jellyfish.\n\u201cAI has developed so fast and there\u2019s so much opportunity, but it\u2019s also kind of a wild West scenario,\u201d said Di Wu, VP of data science at Jellyfish Group. \u201cPeople are just starting to think about regulation and what it means for us to adopt AI. We created a task force around it to basically say, AI is not just about ethics; it\u2019s literally a business problem for us. If we\u2019re not using AI the right way, it could lead to bias because of the training samples used [to train the hypothetical model].\u201d Agencies will soon have access to more tools to create variations on their own work, ensuring ownability.\nWorking within established partner networks is one way to ensure safety, added Yates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stifle innovation in any way, but we do have to think about some of the risk mitigations that go with exploring new technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking closely with Google, for example, is a great opportunity for us to explore a tech stack in a safe and responsible way.\u201d\nEven before the milestones of 2023, Google had partnered with Jellyfish to design a bespoke service powered by Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Vision and Video APIs. \u201cOptics\u201d could decode which elements of an ad performed best according to a brand\u2019s goals and best practices like the YouTube ABCDs. With advances in AI, such methodologies could eventually enable teams to distinguish emotional content across ads, or even the presence of humor, to shed light on which creative choices resonated most with their brands\u2019 audiences.\nOnce teams have finalized creative assets, they can get the most out of them using smart creative formats like RSAs and RDAs. Tools like Performance Max can help make sure the right ad reaches the right audience at the right time, optimized for their chosen channels and screens. Research shows that advertisers see 2X more conversions, on average, when adding an RDA to an ad group with a static display ad.\nFrom creative testing to storyboarding, AI-powered solutions have a pivotal role to play in the future of creative development. The role itself must be defined by the needs of real creative teams, and some of the most useful applications may be found unexpectedly. Through active exploration and experimentation with AI, we can discover more concrete ways of thinking about the guardrails we want to uphold and the benefits to creative professionals they unlock."

        "output": "In the final entry of our three-part series on digital transformation, Google\u2019s Courtney Rose shares how next-generation leaders deal with uncertainty. Part one focused on how organizational shifts help companies transform, and part two explored the role of a strong relationship between CMO and CFO.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent times, the only certainty companies have is uncertainty. This can be challenging for organizations who strive to be digital first, as rapid industry shifts can easily pull their focus away from continuous innovation.\nBut some companies have figured out digital success. When we recently teamed up with Kantar to study how these companies navigated dynamic markets while preparing for the future, we saw a common trait: All had leaders who could boldly face the unknown and confidently change course at a moment\u2019s notice. These leaders transformed the fabric of their organizations, cultivating open-minded, collaborative approaches that sparked innovation, and did it in the face of constant change.\nOur research underscored that this type of next-generation leadership is defined by three behaviors that other companies can implement. The first is proactively operating outside traditional comfort zones. The second involves thinking cross-functionally, and the third focuses on elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\nDuring our research, many next-generation leaders said that building a digitally savvy organization requires CxOs to work outside their comfort zones by thinking broadly about their role and the role of the C-suite, and by responding to change through teamwork and creative problem solving. Our study showed that 70% of executives from digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset, compared to 47% from digitally emerging companies.1\nThis collaborative mindset is key to leading effectively during uncertainty.2 Among the marketing executives we spoke to, 80% of those from digitally leading companies agreed that their organization\u2019s most senior marketer is open to change, compared to 64% of those from digitally emerging companies.3 And leaders who combine traditional and nontechnical skills, like adaptability and intellectual curiosity, are in a better position to develop a culture of collaboration and respond effectively to constant change, particularly when it comes to marketing initiatives.\nAs one CTO said, \u201cChange drives people nuts, but people who embrace it are the ones who can actually help us in the future.\u201d4\nAnother way next-generation leaders help their companies stay flexible during uncertain times is by developing a holistic understanding of their entire organization and encouraging cross-functional teamwork. Executives who told us that their marketing leaders proactively monitored company initiatives happening in areas outside of marketing were also 32% more likely to say their company performed much better than their competitors in revenue growth.5 When leaders think cross-functionally, they create the opportunity for marketing, finance, sales, and IT teams to understand how each group\u2019s operations impact the collective and how they can work together to drive growth and innovation.\nWe also learned that this cross-functional collaboration should extend to the leadership teams themselves. Among digitally leading companies, 70% of the CxOs we surveyed stated that support across the C-suite and the board of directors was critical to successful digital transformation. Just 46% of executives from digitally emerging companies acknowledged this level of leadership support.6\nWhen senior leaders are aligned, they can offer their separate teams a clear, unified strategic vision and shared objectives, which can serve as a North Star during volatile moments. They can also encourage greater cross-functional collaboration by removing hierarchy and helping employees further develop soft skills like communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.\nBeyond ensuring C-suite alignment and collaboration, company leaders can future-proof their organizations by building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors.\nThis starts by ensuring that the board consists of the right people. For example, 82% of marketers from digitally leading companies said their board consists of people who can play a contributing role in supporting digital transformation, while only 42% of marketers from digitally emerging companies made the same claim.7 On top of this, board members who are still active in their professions can provide valuable external perspectives, such as spotting pitfalls, challenging assumptions, and bringing fresh ideas to the table.\nNext, leadership must consider the board\u2019s role in the wider organization. CxOs should encourage the board to move away from simple business signoffs and toward engaging with the company\u2019s overarching strategy. In our study, 1 in 3 senior-level marketers said that the board should push leadership to think creatively and take meaningful risks.8 This can help ensure that the company remains focused on digital innovation during disruptive times.\nWhile business leaders can\u2019t control rapid changes in the market, they very much define how their organizations respond and whether they continue to innovate. Next-generation leaders have proven their resilience and flexibility by stepping out of their comfort zones, fostering companywide collaboration, and empowering boards of directors to take an active, valuable role in their companies\u2019 overarching operations and strategies.\nLearn more about how the next generation of leaders drive growth on the route to digital readiness."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret the media landscape has changed. This past year alone we\u2019ve seen a rise in short-form video and a breakout in AI-powered solutions. People are exposed to a wider variety of content and new ways to consume it, and one-size-fits-all campaigns are no longer enough.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners are blazing new trails by ditching the \u201cmatching luggage\u201d approach and accounting for people\u2019s unique needs. From tapping into YouTube trends to designing bespoke creative across formats, these advertisers expertly created unforgettable YouTube campaigns that resonated with audiences and drove results. Here are four lessons gleaned from the winners.\nLife insurance company MassMutual wanted to drive awareness around a bold topic: money. The brand recognized that conversations about finances are important but aren\u2019t always easy to have. It needed a creative way to grab attention and inspire people to tune into the topic. So it created a lighthearted campaign featuring diverse families having conversations about their financial futures amid unexpected events. The result was an intimate, fly-on-the-wall experience.\nMassMutual sought to make its ads unskippable by breaking the fourth wall, ingeniously utilizing the first six seconds to deliver different variations of the statement, \u201cThis is going to be extremely uncomfortable; you might want to skip this.\u201d This small-but-clever detail showed viewers that MassMutual was directly addressing them, creating a powerful connection.\nThe innovative strategy was wildly successful. In a head-to-head test, its 100% watch rate was 14 percentage points higher and costs per view (CPV) were 2X more cost efficient for creative featuring the made-for-YouTube 6-second add-on.\nSource: MassMutual Internal Data.\nLiv Lewis, EVP of EGAMI Group, praised MassMutual for their authenticity. \u201cNot only did they brilliantly embrace diversity of casting, they embraced diversity as it truly shows up in life.\u201d\nPopular blender brand BlendJet needed a campaign that could drive awareness with new customers and transform existing ones into enthusiastic brand advocates. Its strategy? Create compelling content and engage both audiences. BlendJet tapped into big YouTube trends that have stood the test of time. Assets included YouTube fan favorites such as cake or fakes, bewildering viewers with a blender disguised as a cake, and ASMR videos, soothing them with 10 hours of BlendJet assembly.\nBlendJet also mixed things up to appeal to the next generation of YouTube viewers, using the latest video trend: short form. The brand expertly integrated horizontal and vertical assets with long-form and short-form content to connect with audiences across various viewing preferences.\nReturn on advertising spend and scale allowed BlendJet to increase spend by 55% and helped drive a remarkable 66% revenue growth.\nAs Jonathan Daly, head of communications strategy at Droga5 raved, \u201cThis creative naturally utilizes the super power of YouTube as a social platform. It\u2019s designed to be highly addressable to the audience.\u201d\nOn a mission to rev up consideration, eBay Motors sought a platform that would inspire and excite audiences. That\u2019s why it raced toward YouTube, a go-to destination for inspiration. The brand teamed up with Google\u2019s Creative Works to identify trends and insights, landing on one key insight: People come to YouTube to go deep with the creators and content they love. With that in mind, eBay handed YouTube creators the keys and cocreated a masterfully produced five-part series that pitted modded cars against stock cars, with parts all purchased on eBay. Popular YouTube creator and race-car driver Collete Davis hosted each eight to 12 minute episode, featuring a special guest builder representing a subculture and product category.\nTo maximize viewership, eBay paired episode drops with paid YouTube advertising, and the results were remarkable. The brand grew its YouTube channel subscriber count from 700 to over 37,000 subscribers \u2014 606% above its goal \u2014 while generating more than 9 million views across episodes.\nSource: eBay Internal Data.\nDenise Truelove, global VP of brands at Mars Petcare, sang the team\u2019s praises. \u201cThis is a perfect example of a brand becoming entertainment.\u201d\nBeauty brand Dove also leaned into the power of long-form video to foster engagement. Over the years, Dove has fearlessly taken on the subject of real beauty to address timely issues. Recognizing how important parents\u2019 voices are in shaping children\u2019s self-esteem, the brand created nearly four-minute videos as part of its recent Dove Self-Esteem Project campaign. The videos featured face-mapping technology that put toxic advice into mothers\u2019 mouths, leaving viewers captivated.\nFor the initial push, Dove used YouTube Mastheads and in-feed video ads with a powerful thumbnail image to get people to click and watch the video. Additionally, it used video ad sequencing to prime viewers with a 15-second clip before serving the long-form version. The results spoke for themselves: 6.2 million lifted users associated Dove with raising awareness about the toxic advice girls are exposed to.\nAs Lex Beltrone, group creative director of FCB New York, put it, \u201cThis type of long-form video wouldn\u2019t feel right on any other platform but YouTube.\u201d\nBenjamin Moore, a premium paint manufacturer sold at local retailers around the world, faced a challenge. As businesses reopened and people ventured beyond their homes, home improvement took a back seat. Coupled with the economic headwinds, it was more important than ever for the company to support its local retailers. The brand took an innovative approach. It developed creative showcasing unique end cards for over 1,000 local retailers and paint colors, inspired by each region\u2019s stunning color palettes. Embracing the power of granular geotargeting, Benjamin Moore masterfully reached a small radius around a store\u2019s ZIP code in densely populated areas, while expanding reach in sparsely populated areas.\nIts colorful strategy paid off. Benjamin Moore achieved an average video completion rate of 55% across all regions, exceeding its 45% benchmark, and an impressive 30.4 million views, which was 215% over planned. With this captivating campaign, the brand flawlessly demonstrated that YouTube can help brands achieve a perfect balance of meticulous focus, expansive reach, and authentic user connection.\nSource: Benjamin Moore Internal Data.\nSimilarly, marketing automation platform Mailchimp embraced a full-funnel strategy to connect with small businesses that grapple with marketing challenges. Aiming to drive purchase intent, Mailchimp designed a whimsical campaign, featuring visuals like dancing rugs, to comically depict the confusion marketers often feel. Knowing that small business owners and decision-makers are at different stages of the funnel, it executed a highly tailored approach.\nAt the top of the funnel, it harnessed bumper ads and skippable ads, and tapped into audiences using custom affinity audience targeting to amplify brand reach. For the middle and bottom funnels, the brand shifted focus to driving engaged click volume and used Video action campaigns and audiences like custom intent. Lastly, it reached its most engaged viewers with a sign-up call to action. Moreover, Mailchimp embraced the changing landscape of how and where users watch its video content by harnessing the popularity of short-form video and updating vertical creative.\nThe highly personalized approach paid off, with a 4.2% increase in awareness and a remarkable 34% decrease in cost per paid sign-up year over year.\n\u201cThe ads helped not only empathize with the marketer\u2019s confusion but also gave them the tools and confidence to make tough marketing decisions\u201d marveled Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer and partner of Goodby Silverstein & Partners.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners showcased exceptional talent in tapping into customer needs and implementing innovative strategies to cater to diverse interests. By using the full breadth of YouTube\u2019s capabilities, these brands transformed the platform into a dynamic canvas to showcase their creativity, tell their stories, and authentically connect with their audiences."

        "input": "",
        "output": "AI is transforming marketing in profound and exciting ways. In my conversations with marketers, it\u2019s inspiring to hear how they\u2019re using AI to drive new customer connections, build high-quality creative, and make confident decisions grounded in predictive data.\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that AI can\u2019t drive marketing success by itself. AI is capable of multiplying business results and growth, but only when it\u2019s paired with human expertise. Marketers will continue to be essential in setting clear objectives \u2014 aligned to broader business goals \u2014 so that marketing impact can be accurately measured and decisions about where to invest can be more informed.\nWith that being said, the speed at which technology is evolving can leave even the most innovative marketers wondering whether their current strategies are enough to unlock AI\u2019s full potential and accelerate business growth. That\u2019s where we can help.\nFor several years at Google, we\u2019ve been building products that apply cutting-edge AI to help marketers navigate the rapidly changing landscape. In that time, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with thousands of brands and agencies to accelerate their business growth with AI, and through that experience we\u2019ve learned what works.\nHere are three key areas to prioritize for success with AI.\nA critical, often neglected aspect of AI is the causal relationship between the inputs you give to AI and the business outcomes it can generate. The fact is, AI learns from the data and experience that people provide. The higher quality the inputs, the better the results.\nMarketers who strengthen their measurement strategy and improve the quality of their audience and conversion data, for instance, can guide Google AI to better maximize their ROI. This is particularly true when consented first-party data is an input. Because it comes from direct customer relationships, the data is more durable and uniquely relevant to your business.\nRetailer H&M is a powerful example of how first-party data can be used to improve campaign performance. Last year, H&M\u2019s global head of paid media, Kristoffer Ullenius, and its global digital media analyst, Katarina Ahlner, shared more about their strategy. \u201cWhere we previously didn\u2019t optimize our paid Search campaigns towards acquiring new customers, we now started actively thinking about ways to reach them.\u201d This meant refocusing the strategy to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t buy unless they were influenced by marketing.\nH&M began by deepening its understanding of the value of each customer segment, using a customer life-cycle model rooted in first-party data. This helped the team identify frequent buyers and put less emphasis on reaching them with paid Search, to focus instead on acquiring incremental new customers. Only when customers became less active would they use Search ads to reengage shoppers.\nThis approach, coupled with a shift to a customer-focused Target ROAS bidding strategy, helped H&M grow online revenue from paid Search by more than 70% year over year. According to Ullenius and Ahlner, \u201cAs the whole business moves towards being more customer-centric, it\u2019s been rewarding to see how much impact we can make by focusing our paid efforts on value.\u201d\nWith high-quality data in place, the next key focus area is using AI-powered campaigns to optimize your performance in real time. Every day, we\u2019re seeing that marketers who leverage Google AI can deliver more conversions and get more value out of their campaigns.\nPerformance Max, for example, is a goal-based campaign type that helps advertisers find untapped and incremental opportunities. Advertisers share their campaign goals and creative assets, and our technology automatically produces and runs a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google\u2019s channels.\nSamsung recently put Performance Max to the test across multiple markets to find untapped consumer demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\nAccording to Sandeep Bajpai, director and head of direct-to-consumer marketing at Samsung India, \u201cThe results were phenomenal. With AI-powered campaigns, we doubled our revenue without affecting our return on advertising spend too much.\u201d\nThe final area to prioritize is as critical as data and technology but wholly reliant on people. To get the most out of AI, you need a shared mindset that\u2019s anchored in experimentation and agility.\nIn a recent report created by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, in association with Google, industry leaders shared guidance on how to maximize AI as a business multiplier. Many of them emphasized the importance of a test, learn, and scale mindset, where your team can fail fast but learn quickly which new approaches can unlock profitable growth.\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, explained, \u201cTo protect profitability, experimentation should happen within a controlled environment. Cross-functional teams will need to nurture a test-and-learn culture where leaders can quickly adjust the plan when results don\u2019t come in as expected, or double down on what works.\u201d\nWhile AI solutions may be perceived as disruptive, they can be approached in a gradual manner. Embracing a culture of experimentation is a critical factor for organizations trying to reap the full benefits of AI.\nFor example, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica spent considerable time thoroughly testing AI-powered campaigns and analyzing the business impact of changes to bidding automation, campaign structure, and feed management. According to global performance marketing director Andrea Orlunghi, \u201cTesting new solutions allowed us to create a shared definition of success that spanned across departments.\u201d And its success was tangible. \u201cIn the past two years, combining a wide range of Google AI solutions contributed to nearly a 50% growth in the global online business of EssilorLuxottica.\u201d\nFostering agility by balancing early plans with an ability to pivot is equally important, especially in the context of planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels.\nFor many companies, however, quickly shifting budgets to the biggest opportunities isn\u2019t easy. This is typically due to traditional silos in media channels that carried over to budgets and organizational structures. Unfortunately, these silos can be kryptonite for AI, limiting its ability to optimize and maximize performance.\nBy evolving your multichannel approach to be nimble enough to respond to consumer demands, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to capture incremental performance opportunities as they emerge. This process can be further bolstered by directly aligning marketing KPIs with business goals and partnering with your executive leadership to accurately quantify marketing\u2019s contribution based on key financial metrics. Research shows the results are worth it: Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.1\nIn sharing these AI essentials, it\u2019s my hope that you feel equipped to act today in ways that strengthen your marketing and accelerate business growth for years to come. If you\u2019re interested in learning how you can use Google AI solutions to supercharge your strategy, review the full checklist below and share it with your team."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Kendall Kazor is a member of Google\u2019s People Development School for Googlers team, which produces Resilience at Google, a podcast examining the science behind resilience and high performance. This excerpted interview features a conversation from Season 2.\nCreativity can be hard to define, but it\u2019s an essential skill in today\u2019s workforce. Creativity helps us solve existing challenges and envision new opportunities, and it is considered an X-factor by many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies.\nAs the pace of work and connectivity steadily increases, how do we create the space we need to come up with our best ideas? Can we be creative and productive at the same time? And how do we keep the creative spark lit, even when we start to feel drained? These are questions we hear often from Googlers, but they are not questions unique to Google.\nIn April of this year, we launched a podcast series to help people better understand resilience, which we define as the ability to respond to and recover from stress. Every episode pairs neuroscientists and psychologists with mental performance coaches who discuss the science behind resilience, along with effective ways to react to change and other daily challenges.\nIn the first episode of the podcast\u2019s second season, we focus on creativity \u2014 specifically, how to recharge ourselves and maximize creativity during periods of high stress and transition. For this conversation, we were joined by digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush and associate professor of sport and performance psychology at Nottingham Trent University Dr. Mustafa Sarkar.\nWe\u2019re all striving to be our best, and often we equate that with being productive. Rahaf, you wrote a book called \u201cHustle and Float,\u201d which is a helpful concept for thinking about productivity. Can you explain it?\nRahaf Harfoush: \u201cHustle and float\u201d is a phrase borrowed from white-water rafting. It\u2019s the idea that, to have a good rafting trip, you need a mix of hustle and float. There\u2019s a period when you have to exert yourself to make the raft go where you want it to go, to move forward. But there are also periods when you have to lift your oar and let the river do the work. Too much of one or the other will ruin your trip. Too much hustle, and you\u2019ll get exhausted and make mistakes that can be dangerous. Too much float, and it\u2019s boring; you don\u2019t get where you want to go and are at the mercy of the river. The idea is that, in order to successfully navigate, we have to balance between when we do the work and when the river does the work. And that\u2019s easily applied to productivity culture: We\u2019re so accustomed to hustling, we don\u2019t remember how to float.\nCreativity helps solve big problems, which makes it a fundamental leadership capability we all need. Mustafa, when we consider team resilience, creativity is such a key part of navigating challenges and uncertainty. You study high-performance teams. What specifically have you noticed about managers and other leaders?\nMustafa Sarkar: Team learning is vital to resilience; teams that are on the same wavelength are better able to respond as a collective to difficult situations. Teams need time and space to perform in this way, and leaders are critical to shaping an environment and intentionally creating time and space for creativity. Effective leaders also have influence over the ideas that are generated.\nPrioritizing time and space for creativity is so important. But there\u2019s a misconception that prioritizing creativity comes at the expense of productivity. How do we overcome that to embrace the idea that focused work and detachment give teams a competitive advantage?\nHarfoush: Since we define productivity as continuous visual output, we tend to obsess over visible work performance. For most of us, the visible work \u2014 the presentation to the client, the final research report \u2014 is just a fraction of our process, maybe 25%. The remaining 75% is unseen, and so we think it\u2019s invisible to performance. And, from a resiliency perspective, we are accustomed to optimizing and getting drained as if it\u2019s an end state to be celebrated, rather than treating our creative energy as a sustainable resource to be renewed and replenished strategically.\nSarkar: There\u2019s an analogy about a cellphone battery: As humans, we often wait until we are at 5% energy to recharge, but we would never wait until our phone is at 5% battery power to charge it. We\u2019d probably start charging it at 30%. Why do we do it with our phones but not ourselves?\nWe know our best ideas and our best performance moments come after the rest, and we see that proven by professional athletes all the time. Why is it so hard to slow down?\nHarfoush: There\u2019s a myth that says your success is solely dependent on your ability to work hard. And that anytime you\u2019re not actively demonstrating that you\u2019re working hard, you are signaling that you\u2019re not deserving of your own success. In reality, we know that hard work can move the needle, yes, but there are so many other factors.\nSarkar: An important thing to consider when we talk about work devotion is identity and what fills your life outside of work. If you have multiple identities \u2014 if you\u2019re a father, a mother, a footballer, an exerciser, a cook, whatever it may be \u2014 you\u2019ll consider those aspects of your life very important. But if your identity is solely tied to work, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll see yourself and your success.\nOften there is a badge of honor around how hard we all work, especially among high performers. How can companies go about shifting that belief system?\nSarkar: Resilience is cultivated by design, not by default. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically, and that\u2019s why focusing on the work environment is so important. As a leader or manager, you must focus on proactively creating an environment where it is safe for people to speak up when they see things that aren\u2019t healthy, and creating opportunities where you can hold up your hand and acknowledge your own mistakes.\nHarfoush: To build on that, it\u2019s important to consider questions that contribute to environment: What does success look like here? What behaviors do we hold up as aspirational? How do we measure performance? How do we define performance?\nI also encourage clients to start with small experiments. Make hypotheses about what you think you can prove through experimentation. Maybe you\u2019ll see better strategic thinking and fewer mistakes when people aren\u2019t sleep deprived and overstressed. Get the data and build on what you learn.\nOne of the top questions we get from people managers at Google has been: What can I do now to increase my team\u2019s resilience and productivity down the road? What\u2019s your advice?\nSarkar: Resilience boils down to cultivating relationships, particularly because of remote and hybrid work. There\u2019s a saying that \u201cstrangers can\u2019t team,\u201d and many of us are in a situation now where we don\u2019t know our teammates. Working to cultivate relationships and shared values is more critical than ever.\nHarfoush: Productivity is a reflection of a system, and it can be anything that you want. So if you want to increase your team\u2019s productivity, then it\u2019s critical to specify what that means. Is it increased time for deep work? More periods of intense collaboration? Eliminating distractions through prioritization?\nAnother thing for managers to think about is anti-fragility \u2014 not just helping your team be productive and resilient through disruption, but using the disruption to grow and be better. As strategic thinkers, we have to be adaptive and responsive, and challenge assumptions and evolve. All of those things require a different relationship to change. So as leaders, we must really get to know ourselves, our creativity, our energy, and what drains and replenishes us.\nDownload and listen to the full conversation on Google Podcasts or wherever you find your favorite shows."

Use these three tips to help you drive more sales with up to 3 billion people as they scroll through content on YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.\nYour images will be the first thing people notice when they come across your Discovery ads, so be sure to use the highest possible image resolution. Also, highlight your product or service to help people instantly understand what you\u2019re showcasing.\nTo more accurately illustrate how your products or services work, upload the highest resolution images possible (1200x628, 960x1200, and 1200x1200 pixels) and consider using images that show people using your products. Based on an internal analysis with Creative Works (formerly Unskippable Labs), images with a person drive 4% more clicks compared to images without a person.1\nUse overlay text sparingly. It can have a varied appearance on different devices and create a less compelling experience for people scrolling through their feeds. Our internal analysis with Creative Works shows that, on average, images without overlay text drive 9% more clicks.2\nAudiences, messaging, and creative assets that have performed well for your other media campaigns, such as video or social, can help you unlock performance with highly engaged audiences on Discovery ads. Be sure to include at least 10 converting Search campaign keywords in each of your custom intent audiences, and make the most of Google\u2019s automated audience features: Advertisers who use audience expansion with Discovery ads see 52% more conversions at a comparable cost per acquisition to their originally selected audience.3\nIn summer 2020, U.K. fashion brand Ted Baker used its social ads creative assets to build Discovery campaigns, connecting with previous website visitors and shoppers interested in clothing. As a result, Ted Baker saw a revenue lift of 70% and a 62% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) in under one year.\nAutomated campaign types need the right budget, a variety of great assets, and enough time to analyze the performance of your ads to determine which settings for your creative assets and bids work the best across your audiences. Your campaign optimizes your settings for peak performance over time.\nIf you\u2019re running Discovery ads for the first time, give your campaign time and space to learn what works by choosing an average daily budget at least 10 times the value of your target cost-per-action bid. Then wait for at least 40 conversions before making any changes. Whenever you change your assets, audiences, or bids, your campaign will need two to three weeks to adjust and optimize for the best results.\nFor more detailed examples and tips for how to set up Discovery ads, check out our full best practices guide."

Here, actor, author, and advocate Selma Blair explains why it\u2019s time for media to shift toward a world where everyone sees themselves represented and how to build belonging into media. A version of this article first appeared in Variety on July 19, 2022.\nStorytelling is powerful. Stories can ultimately shape your identity and how the world sees you.\nThroughout my life, my story has been told by other people: Manic depressive. Drunk. Mean.\nIn my memoir, \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I wrote about never feeling a sense of belonging. Throughout my life, I often felt disconnected from my body, out of control, as if I didn\u2019t belong in my own skin. I learned not to show or talk about pain because I didn\u2019t want it to define me, nor did I understand what my pain meant.\nIn 2018, I was finally able to tell other people how I identified myself: disabled. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and learned it had been attacking my central nervous system for years. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have anyone in the entertainment industry to look up to who had a disability or was open about their diagnosis, and I didn\u2019t see my experiences reflected in the stories being told on screen. Even though it was difficult learning I had MS, at least it had a name now. After being confused about who I was for so long, I finally understood myself \u2014 and I belonged to a community. In a way, it was also freeing.\nI started thinking more about the power of storytelling and why representation in media matters. If I had seen and heard from people who were like me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone. Perhaps if I\u2019d had more diverse representation to look up to, I would have learned about my own diagnosis earlier on (I was shocked when I learned one of my idols, Joan Didion, also had MS).\nNow I truly feel comfortable embracing all parts of my identity \u2014 including my disability \u2014 and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time we shift the story about how disabled people are represented. It\u2019s one of the reasons I started looking at the work Google has been doing to build inclusive practices into its marketing. United by shared values and a vision that authentically represents disabled people\u2019s stories, I want to help the rest of the creative industry use Google\u2019s learnings to build a world where everyone belongs.\nSince my diagnosis, I\u2019ve become close friends with Andra\u00e9a LaVant, a leading voice in the disability community and founder of LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and communications firm. I\u2019ve learned so much from her and her team and the work they\u2019ve been doing with brands, including how they\u2019ve supported Google to bring disability into its advertising and internal programs. All In, Google\u2019s inclusive marketing toolkit, draws on years of internal insights and collaborations to build intentionality into every step of its advertising process.\nIn partnership with LaVant Consulting and many other leading organizations, Google launched an accessible marketing playbook on All In as a practical guide for every marketing effort. This is such a powerful resource for so many reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s informed by the lived experiences of people with disabilities.\nThis approach deeply reflects a core principle in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. Who better to build a strong sense of belonging for disabled people than we who belong to the community?\nWhile I want to use my voice to support the disability community, I also strongly believe that I can\u2019t be the only spokesperson for everyone with a disability. Our experience is ours alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pull in as many people and experts from the community as possible.\nIn addition to LaVant Consulting, Google has worked with Disability:IN, GLAAD, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Ad Council, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (The 4A\u2019s), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, Cannes Lions, and many other expert organizations across the world to create All In and contribute to Google\u2019s continued inclusivity practice.\nThis level of collaboration creates space for the more than 1 billion disabled people around the world. It also acknowledges that each person has a unique background and set of circumstances. My disability is just one identity, and my experience is just that \u2014 one person\u2019s experience. Disability will touch everyone at some point in their life, whether permanent, temporary, visible, invisible, or age related. Partnering with diverse experts and perspectives also emphasizes the opportunity to consider people\u2019s whole identities, including gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education.\nThis matters beyond advertising, All In\u2019s original focus. There is a movement happening, and the entertainment industry needs to be a part of this cultural shift. Everyone benefits from accessibility, because it opens up work to a wider, more diverse audience.\nI\u2019ve already learned a lot through the accessible marketing playbook on All In; it would have been a helpful resource while I was writing \u201cMean Baby.\u201d For example, throughout my memoir I described people as \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair.\u201d The playbook suggests that a more inclusive description would be \u201cwheelchair user\u201d or \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d This is a great example of something that may seem small, yet is so impactful.\nAll In also taught me that disability inclusion is a mindset, not a box to check. It requires a sustained commitment, a constantly evolving work process, and ongoing learning for each and every one of us. This is important for us to remember if we\u2019re to make meaningful change.\nIn \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I write that the thing about limitations is that they aren\u2019t really about you at all. They\u2019re often constructed by others, and when they\u2019re removed, you realize that all this time you\u2019ve been capable of soaring.\nThe entertainment industry has the ability to do so much to help tear down these limitations. Committing to accessibility breaks down barriers, enabling creatives to be better in their work. It\u2019s time for the wider creative media industry to commit to inclusion and elevate the significance of this growing cultural shift. Everyone deserves to have their story represented authentically and feel a sense of belonging.\nWhether you\u2019re a producer, creator, marketer, or actor, All In is for you. These are steps anybody can take today. Commit to helping change the creative industry to be more inclusive by learning how on Google.com/All-In."

        "output": "Data analytics should be top of mind for every advertiser, but building a successful and effective analytics team can be challenging. Here, Google marketing and analytics leaders break down key principles businesses can use to realize the potential of a tech-savvy analytics team.\nDigital transformation \u2014 the process of using digital technologies to modernize business performance, agility, and sustainability \u2014 is widely seen by marketing leaders as the key to future-proofing organizations. To get the most out of digital innovations, companies must be able to pinpoint where to focus their efforts and to understand what strategies are working best. That\u2019s why a strong data analytics team that can communicate real-time data insights to the C-suite is crucial to driving meaningful digital transformation.\nCompanies that build a successful analytics team are more likely to see revenue, profit, and market share gains.1 Yet, according to the Digital Maturity Benchmark, only 9% of businesses use insights and technology effectively to create better consumer experiences. Why?\nThrough Google\u2019s own experience building world-leading analytics teams and our work with hundreds of other companies, we\u2019ve identified three core principles that can help businesses overcome challenges and build successful analytics strategies and teams.\nWhen it comes to investing in your organization\u2019s analytics, prioritize people over tools. Investing in people leads to a flexible analytics capability, which can adapt to a changing business environment without locking the organization into an unwieldy system of software and tools.\nWhile many Fortune 500 companies have made great investments in analytics tools, most still struggle to make meaningful data-driven business decisions. That\u2019s largely because this investment strategy makes the mistake of thinking that tools, rather than people, are the solution to building better analytics. The tools themselves can only go so far without the right people behind them.\nThese misplaced efforts led us to develop a 10/90 rule for web analytics success: Invest 10% of the analytics budget in tools and the remaining 90% in people. For example, if you\u2019re paying a web analytics vendor $25,000 for an annual contract, you should be prepared to invest a further $225,000 in people to get meaningful value from that data.\nTo be sure, software systems and vendor professional services are important components of a successful analytics team. But it\u2019s the analysts, not the tools, who transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the 10/90 rule, CxOs can draw on the winning combination of computer processing power and human judgment to inform marketing activities and business decisions, and understand consumer behaviors.\nAnalytics teams thrive in dynamic environments that reward curiosity, encourage innovation, and set high expectations. Building and reinforcing this type of culture can help put organizations on a path to earning impactful returns from analytics investments.\nAn active analytics culture thrives when CxOs reward curiosity over perfection. Encourage analysts to challenge convention and ask questions as a method to improve quality and reduce risks. This thinking goes hand in hand with a test-and-learn mentality, where pushing boundaries through proactive experimentation helps identify what works, and optimize accordingly.\nIt\u2019s also important to create a culture where failure and success are celebrated equally. Giving airtime to what went wrong allows the team to more effectively learn from their mistakes and see that perfection is an unhealthy pipe dream. This encourages an environment that holds analysts accountable for delivering quality processes and results, further helping to mitigate risk and improve marketing programs.\nHigh-performing analytics capabilities cannot and will not happen without the full commitment of an organization\u2019s senior leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that leaders collaborate with analysts to understand the data behind decision-making.\nC-level leaders can create an analytics-friendly environment by knowing when to collect data, presenting business challenges to analyst teams, and consistently seeking to quantify goals and objectives. Leading by example, data-savvy CxOs can show leaders that it\u2019s better to go to analyst teams with problems to solve rather than requests for specific deliverables, championing these non-analysts to be experts in their distinct businesses \u2014 rather than analytics.\nMaintaining a winning analytics capability requires endorsement up and down an organization. This sets the tone for a company that values understanding measurement solutions as well as the problem-solving expertise analysts can deliver across the organization.\nNow\u2019s the time for businesses to establish a data-centric culture that positions them to win with analytics today and in the future. Companies that do it are more effective and efficient, earn impactful insights from their data, and can attract and retain top-tier analytics talent.\nSo start laying the foundation for your company\u2019s in-house data analytics infrastructure immediately. Audit your organization\u2019s current analytics capabilities to identify gaps and opportunities in your marketing strategy. Then, identify what leadership you need to close gaps in capability and design by successfully implementing the principles we\u2019ve shared.\nBuild your organization\u2019s own high-performing analytics team, and join the future-ready businesses that are taking their marketing further."

Feminine hygiene brands have used blue liquid and women wearing white jeans or bikinis as the \u201cacceptable\u201d way to advertise their products for decades. Not anymore. Raw, confronting, but sensitive and sympathetic, this 3-minute TrueView ad is crafted with exceptional detail and authenticity, stemming from an insight-led creative development process. While maximizing the benefits of TrueView\u2019s long-form format, tight pacing ensures not a single frame is wasted.\nIn 2020, Think with Google profiled AMV BBDO\u2019s creative team who brought #wombpainstories to life, in Episode 4 of Meet the Makers.\n\nShortlisted for the Titanium Lions, this powerful campaign cuts straight to the heart, questioning the dichotomy of a world that can celebrate Black culture and creativity, while allowing racial injustice and inequality to persist.

        "input": "",
        "output": "While some brands are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their messaging and marketing campaigns, an essential component of inclusivity may be missing: accessibility.\nIt's especially important to cater to people who are typically underserved in the digital world. For example, people who are blind or have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, are neurodivergent, or those who have motor conditions. These individuals often face barriers when an experience is not properly designed. Online journeys are often convoluted experiences for people, and brands need to ensure their apps and websites don\u2019t add further complications.\nBuilding accessible user experiences will soon become a regulatory requirement too. This year, European Union member states are adopting the European Accessibility Act into their laws. The expectation is that all products and online services will need to be accessible once the requirements come into force in 2025.\nSo where do you start on your accessibility journey? We\u2019ve spoken with four brands about how they think about and build for accessibility and disability inclusiveness. Here\u2019s what we learned.\nAdvertising is powerful because it connects with people through storytelling. But what if someone misses key elements of that story? This question led consumer goods manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G) to incorporate audio description, a voice-over describing what\u2019s happening, into their video ads.\n\u201cThe introduction of audio description stems from my personal experiences,\u201d explains Sam Latif, company accessibility leader at P&G, who is blind. \u201cI was in a meeting when an ad for Flash played, but all I could hear was the song \u2018Flash\u2019 by Queen. What I didn\u2019t realize was that a dog was singing that song, because, without audio description, I couldn\u2019t understand the humor of the ad.\u201d\nThe P&G team worked with The Royal National Institute of Blind People to learn how audio description is done and integrated it into its ads.\nP&G didn\u2019t stop there. In 2021, they launched the first audio-described Super Bowl ad. It also ran its first adaptive audio description trial in the U.K. This means applying audio description to TV ads that don\u2019t have enough natural gaps in the dialogue to provide a description. And, most recently, it added audio description to its YouTube channel.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have all the answers but are proud of the progress we have made,\u201d says Latif. \u201cExperiences like this have led to change, with audio description opening up our advertising to millions more people around the world.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway conducts research directly with people with disabilities, from customers who are blind or have low vision to those with nonvisible disabilities, such as dyslexia. Its goal: understand people\u2019s first-hand experiences when using the delivery app and build inclusive products.\n\u201cObserving people with access needs using our app has been a strong facilitator of change and awareness across the organization,\u201d says Naoil Sbai, a global research team lead at the company. \u201cIt helped us realize the impact that simple changes could make. And it made us rethink how people interact with our app.\u201d\nThis motivated the research team to identify optimization opportunities with the Android Accessibility Scanner. The automated tool flagged key recommendations, such as increasing the size of touch targets \u2014 the tappable space around a navigation button.\nOnce this issue was known, it took them just a day to make the touch targets bigger. Something seemingly small \u2014 and a quick fix \u2014 can make a world of difference to customers, especially those with limited dexterity. And, as a bonus, this makes it easier for anyone to order their food quickly while on-the-go.\nL'Or\u00e9al had accessibility front of mind when building its new website. \u201cThe first step toward accessibility is to understand the different types of disabilities and how they affect millions of people,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Cunche, the beauty company\u2019s digital project director.\nWhen it learned how customers with low vision and cognitive conditions use the website, it set out to raise awareness within the company. It adopted the industry-standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to improve the website experience. And it partnered with an agency that specializes in this topic to help implement the guidelines across the business.\nWith the basic foundations in place, the product team took it one step further by layering on additional features. For example, they now offer accessibility controls in the website navigation menu, so people can select settings based on their needs.\nThe first feature is high-contrast mode. This removes background images and allows people to view the site in a strong white-on-black contrast, making it easier to read and focus on the content.\nThe team also added an option to deactivate animations to reveal a static header image on the page instead. This can help people with vestibular disorders, for whom motion can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea.\n\u201cAfter several tests and user surveys, all results are very positive and encourage us to go further,\u201d continues Cunche. \u201cWith knowledge comes responsibility, and only then can we create a better digital experience \u2014 for everyone.\u201d\nBooking.com is a large and complex organization, with many teams working on different elements of the digital travel company\u2019s app. As different people, code, and designs feed into the app, some features don\u2019t always behave as they should.\nFor example, during testing, the accessibility team found that some navigational tabs were not working correctly with screen readers \u2014 software that reads visual information from the screen out loud. In some instances, the screen reader would read out the wrong tab. Someone wanting to navigate to the \u201cCar Rentals\u201d section could be accidentally directed to the \u201cTaxis\u201d page.\nThe accessibility team partnered with the design systems team to update the components \u2014 the building blocks within an app \u2014 so that accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, were built in from the start.\n\u201cIf we use components that are accessible by default, we can innovate and be agile, without having to focus on getting it right all the time, every time,\u201d explains Booking.com Engineering Manager and Accessibility Lead Parham Doustdar. Doustdar has been blind since birth and is an expert at navigating websites and apps with screen readers, so this accessibility issue was very familiar to him.\nHowever, this work didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, because some legacy components did not reflect the changes. The team partnered with another group in their organization to update the technology so the accessibility changes could be adopted throughout the entire app. Now, as pages are built and updated, everyone working on the app automatically uses components that have accessibility built in.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter how accessible your components are if no one is using them,\u201d continues Doustdar. \u201cYou have to harness existing initiatives, where possible, and partner with other teams to increase adoption.\u201d\nHere are some final tips to help you improve accessibility.\nAnd, above all, know that people\u2019s varied needs continue to change, so you\u2019re never finished creating more accessible user experiences. The most important thing is to start."

        "output": "Ben Jones is the global director of Google's Creative Works, a newly formed team with the mission of helping brands drive better business results with more effective creative.\nNo matter what tools or technology you have at your disposal, good creative is the last unfair advantage of ads that work. It\u2019s only natural that marketing and creative teams develop their own \u201crules\u201d about what makes for effective creative on YouTube ads. We often find that those rules could benefit from a reframe. The truth is, successful brands on YouTube use creative strategies and mindsets that bust assumptions. Here are a few misperceptions we've encountered and some suggestions for how you might reframe them into best practices for YouTube ad creative.\nYou should absolutely take risks on YouTube. But that doesn\u2019t mean shooting in the dark to find what works. There are some basic principles to making effective YouTube ads, and these principles can inform which risks are worth taking. The ABCDs of effective creative on YouTube are based on years of research on tens of thousands of ads from all over the world to uncover which specific creative elements contribute to the biggest impact on YouTube.\nAds that follow the ABCDs as a guide have been shown to yield 30% lift in short-term sales likelihood and 17% lift in long-term brand contribution.1 There\u2019s still plenty of room to build creatively on those foundations, but keeping them in mind will better equip you to take those risks and make more effective creative choices.\nWhile there are certainly creative principles you can start with, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to execution. Looking at the wide spectrum of effective YouTube ads across marketing objectives around the world, we\u2019ve found that focusing on what your ad says and how it makes people feel is more important than the way your ad looks.\nEffective YouTube ads can be many things, like an episodic docu-series, an undercover investigation, a user-narrated product review, or an interview with the CEO. It can be a music video partnership with a YouTube creator that becomes the No. 1 most-watched video in the world in its first 24 hours, leading to a 100% increase in year-over-year sales. It can even be an anime series starring the product as the hero, which sells out immediately, beats the team\u2019s KPIs, and boosts year-over-year product sales by more than 100%.\nYouTube is a breeding ground for creativity, and advertisers have as much of an opportunity to participate in that as anyone else on the platform. Effective ads give viewers a taste of your brand, product, or service \u2014 and that leaves a lot of room for creativity.\nSometimes ads that are meant to drive action get a bad rap. There\u2019s concern that lower-funnel ads cheapen the story or sell the brand short. But we\u2019ve seen brands get really creative with calls to action. It just requires thinking about the ad as the start of the viewer\u2019s next action, allowing the work to extend beyond that one impression. This is especially important on YouTube where 63% of viewers in the markets we\u2019ve studied say they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on the platform.2\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, AR, AU, BR, CA, CL, CO, FR, IT IN, JP, MX, PE, KR, ES, U.K., U.S., Why Video study, n=32075, A18-64 gen pop video users, March 2020\u2013Aug. 2020.\nA creative way to customize lower-funnel ads is to align with the viewer\u2019s passion points and make a more directed offer. Or you could employ a bit of reverse psychology like McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia did, when the team told viewers not to search for a product, knowing that would spark curiosity and encourage them to do just that.\nGucci U.K. got creative with ad sequencing to hone in on viewers most interested in its products as part of its holiday season campaign. Partnering with filmmaker Harmony Korine, the team produced a colorful, nostalgia-tinged video ad. With ad sequencing, they first raised awareness by featuring a campaign teaser video that led to the full director's cut on YouTube. Then, to increase consideration, Gucci showed a 6-second bumper ad series to viewers who showed interest in the teaser. Finally, the brand served product-focused ads to those viewers using TrueView for action and TrueView for shopping ads that connected them directly with the link to purchase. The campaign itself was viewed 5.4 million times globally with a 58% view completion rate, and it drove 44.5K clicks to Gucci\u2019s website.\nThere\u2019s a difference between having an experimental approach to creating video ads and conducting a one-off test. The former is a mindset that reaps deep learnings and keeps you from relying on long-held assumptions. The latter is a thing you do every once in a while, and works best for campaign-specific learnings.\nAn experimental mindset doesn\u2019t have to slow you down or cost you more, and it will pay off in the long term. Think of every campaign your brand puts out there as an experiment. See what you learn, which new questions emerge, and what needs to be optimized. Advertisers who successfully used Video Experiments saw 60% higher ad recall from the better performing creative.3\nSource: Google Data, Global, Successful Video Experiments were those with a significant difference in Brand Lift between experiment arms, 2019\u20132020.\nStart by changing one variable (big or small), like simple edits to the pace, the framing of your opening shot, or a variety of copy tweaks. Even the smallest changes can make a big impact. The more you experiment, the more you will understand not only what levers to pull creatively for your brand, but deeper insights about your audience.\nAspiration, a digital banking alternative focused on social good, has taken an experimental mindset when it comes to video creative. The team consistently tests through the entire production process. They run ads with variants of headlines, calls to action, and even landing pages to fully optimize their creative for success. By running different versions and looking at Brand Lift and Search lift results, they\u2019re able to determine the more effective creative to put their weight behind. Thanks to these optimizations and experiments, Aspiration was able to drive a 25% lift in relative brand awareness, over 16,000 email leads, and more than 3,400 new users.\nCreating assets tailored for each platform usually requires more lift than most brands and creative teams can spare. What we\u2019ve found is that when you start with a digital audience in mind, by grabbing attention immediately; building for mobile with tighter framing, large-type text, and color contrast for visibility on smaller screens; and with sound on, your ads will perform better everywhere, including on TV.\nThen for YouTube in particular, layer on some of its specific capabilities like personalizing your video ads at scale, like the Greek pizza chain Pizza Fan, or transforming a TV spot into a multipart video ad using ad sequencing, like LinkedIn U.K.\nIn its first ever brand-led campaign, LinkedIn U.K. had a beautiful 60-second TV spot. The team devised a test. They would run the TV spot on YouTube to see how it performed, and they would also run tailored-for-YouTube assets: four separate short-form videos that featured a large on-screen logo, with sound on, and sequenced together to serve to viewers over time. Hands down, the YouTube-tailored assets performed better. \u201cWe saw increased consideration by 20%, ad recall up 178%, and a campaign that was 2.3X more cost efficient in driving brand lift,\u201d said Katriona O\u2019Leary, the brand\u2019s group manager for paid media.\nGreat brands around the world are constantly pushing to rethink long-held assumptions about what works on YouTube. Follow the foundational principles of effective creative, think creatively, build for digital, and take advantage of the capabilities YouTube offers \u2014 all with an experimental mindset \u2014 and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making effective video ad creative.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio. Create with Google curates the creative insight, inspiration, and tools you need to make effective creative work \u2014 all in one place."

Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, and Mailine Swildens, director of Google EMEA\u2019s Creative Works, present the report comprising those insights.\nWe live in an era when, in nearly every arena of human endeavor, the status quo has been buffeted by a combination of rapid flux, profound innovation, and global uncertainty. New demands have shattered old assumptions, confident forecasts have been mocked by unexpected developments, and standard operating procedures have failed to meet the moment.\nAll of which has ushered in a golden age for creativity.\nAt Google, we saw an opportunity to explore what this means, in and for the creative ecosystem. We invited some of our most forward-thinking creative leaders and partners to join the Creative Works team in a different kind of project \u2014 a project whose aim wasn\u2019t to provide the right answers but to provoke the right questions.\nBeyond publishing a definitive report, our goal was to start a critical dialogue that we believe is more necessary today than ever before. We call it the Open Creative Project, and we invite you to join us in the conversation."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dorothea Wiesmann Rothuizen and Wojtek Skut are engineers at Google, where they work on continually improving AI and large language models. They are a part of the team implementing new capabilities into Google Ads features, such as broad match.\nThere\u2019s been a wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, largely due to immense improvements in the underlying technology. Large language models (LLMs), for example, now enable a deeper understanding of language, which has led to conversations with AI that are much more natural and intuitive.\nThis same technology has supercharged broad match, a Google Ads setting that helps brands reach more people with their ads and reduces manual keyword work.\nWhile broad match has existed since the dawn of Google Ads, its early version wasn\u2019t perfect and began losing momentum about 15 years ago. Back then, it could have matched a search query, such as \u201ctreating a pet at home,\u201d to an irrelevant keyword, like \u201ctreats for pets.\u201d At the same time, \u201ctreating a pet at home\u201d would not have matched to the related \u201cwithout a vet,\u201d since the two phrases don\u2019t contain any of the same words. But, thanks to new advances in AI and continuous updates, broad match has evolved and can now better interpret nuance and context.\nIn fact, today\u2019s broad match understands people\u2019s search queries on a deeper level and can identify keyword search intent. This makes it one of the most effective solutions for search advertising.\nBelieve it or not, when broad match first launched, Google\u2019s engineering team would manually write out the synonyms for a keyword and cast a really wide net. For example, an ad keyword including \u201ccheap\u201d could match with searches for \u201cinexpensive\u201d and \u201cshoestring.\u201d While \u201cshoestring\u201d can be a different way of saying \u201cbudget,\u201d a user could alternatively use this word to search for shoelaces.\nThanks to new AI capabilities, LLMs can now better understand a user\u2019s search intent. We train them with billions of pieces of text so they can learn all the different variations and meanings of a word or phrase, and what sequences make sense. Once that fundamental foundation is in place, we will assign the AI a specific task, like matching ads to search queries.\nWhile the language technology can understand the potential demand that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s most effective when combined with Smart Bidding. This automated bidding strategy factors in a wide range of signals and surrounding data points in a privacy-safe way \u2014 such as search history, interests, and past purchases \u2014 to build a predictive model that helps advertisers identify the audiences most likely to convert.\nHere are three of the most significant improvements we\u2019ve made to broad match.\nIn the early days of broad match, the technology would connect the dots between keywords in a search query and an ad, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the order of the words in the query into account.\nFor instance, someone looking for a flight from London to Paris could have been shown an ad for a flight from Paris to London. To prevent this from happening, Google\u2019s search specialists would\u2019ve recommended a different keyword strategy to those advertisers. But today, broad match knows that going from A to B isn\u2019t the same as going from B to A. This improvement has also been applied to other areas where a search query only works one way.\nHere\u2019s an example. A user might be looking for a place to \u201cexchange euros to pounds\u201d or searching for a \u201cusb to usbc cable,\u201d and seeing an ad in which these words are in reverse order would not be relevant to them. Fortunately, the latest version of broad match now understands their search intent.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve often been asked: \u201cWhat happens when two ads for the same advertiser match to the same search query?\u201d Previously, broad match would have looked at an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank to help determine which ad to show, but which may not always have been the best choice.\nTo improve relevance \u2014 for advertisers and users \u2014 today\u2019s broad match considers supporting information, such as other keywords in the ad group and even the ad\u2019s landing page. And, thanks to the increased capabilities of the LLM that powers broad match, it better understands the meaning of a search query and its variations to improve relevance there too.\nMultilingual search is a third area that has seen a lot of development. Broad match now recognizes that some people might switch between languages when looking for something online, and it uses that information to serve the right ads.\nThe expat community is a common use case. For example, Turkish people living in the Netherlands or British people residing in Spain may be searching in their first language but looking for local-language results for the country they live in.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that running your campaign in one language means that you\u2019ll get traffic for other languages, since campaign success still relies on language settings and localized creative. But, in countries where many people are bilingual, it\u2019s helpful to know that broad match can match relevant, local traffic to an ad, even when the search is made in another language.\nBroad match may not be quite as old as \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d but it\u2019s been around for a long time. And, just like in the iconic 1985 movie, it shows us that sometimes looking at something from the past helps you understand its value in the present.\nThat said, while AI-powered language upgrades have made broad match far more effective for search advertising, it will continue to need a smart marketer in the driver\u2019s seat. Savvy marketers will check performance, select the right bidding strategy, and monitor new queries identified by broad match to bring in new customers. After all, you might discover new insights about your audience throughout the campaign.\nAI learns from you, and you learn from AI. Broad match\u2019s success depends on the team that uses it, just like the time-traveling car from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d needed the input and creativity from its creator, Doc Brown, to drive into the past \u2014 and the future.Tune into the Google Marketing Platform Partner Podcast episode \u201cTalking AI: How a deeper language understanding is transforming broad match\u201d to hear more about the ways large language models are supercharging broad match.

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s business environment, planning ahead simply isn\u2019t enough. Marketers need to balance early planning with an ability to pivot. Especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty when budgets are under pressure, marketing and finance teams must work together even more closely to effectively deploy resources and maximize ROI.\nAn ingrained benefit of digital marketing has always been the ability to quickly change media plans and constantly optimize. More than ever, marketers have to lean into an agile mindset to shift budgets to the biggest opportunities. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy task.\nIn my past CMO roles at Calvin Klein Inc. and L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, I remember how often industry media buying platforms were distinctly siloed by channel: search, online video, display, social, and more. These silos carried over to our budget and organizational structures, creating friction and inefficiency whenever we tried to optimize performance across many marketing channels.\nBut as technology and solutions like AI and machine learning have rapidly improved, so have opportunities to show up for customers in more connected and consistent ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a multiplying force for businesses. You can more precisely scale your marketing presence across channels, stay on top of consumer needs and trends, and achieve new levels of agility within your marketing.\nThese opportunities are empowering marketers to rethink their old approaches to multichannel digital campaigns to improve ROI. To better understand this shift, Google partnered with Kantar to survey over 2,400 global marketers and explore the importance of agility in planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels. From this study, we\u2019ve identified three core areas that require a careful balancing act to unlock greater agility and developed guiding principles for success.\nWhile initial budget planning is considered fundamental, marketers should also leave room for flexibility. In our study, marketers are considered behaviorally budget agile if they adjust budgets across digital channels on a weekly or more frequent basis. Based on this metric, nearly a quarter of the marketers surveyed are considered budget agile.1\nBudget agile does not, however, mean unprepared. Thirty-one percent of budget-agile marketers engage in formal marketing planning to align on strategy and digital-media budget allocations every month versus 18% of non-agile marketers.2\nBeing budget agile can also lead to better business outcomes. Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 And 48% of budget-agile marketers state that their marketing performance exceeded internal expectations and marketing KPIs, compared to 33% of marketers who are not budget agile.4\nThis finding did surprise us: Many of the marketers surveyed considered themselves more budget agile than they actually are based on their budgeting behaviors. On average, 60% of marketers who say they are \u201cextremely agile\u201d only make budget adjustments across digital channels monthly or less frequently.5\nWhile this gap between perception and actual behavior happens at all levels of an organization, C-level executives are 2X more likely than individual contributors to perceive their business as extremely budget agile.6\nThe disconnect between perceived and actual budget agility reveals that there\u2019s room for improvement across organizations. For me personally, empowering my teams to work with greater agility means I need to step back and allow them to make faster decisions. But this isn\u2019t the case for many businesses. Indeed, the budget approval process is quite lengthy for 54% of non-agile marketers, where changes to digital budgets of 20% or more take a month or longer for approval.7 And even agile marketers must deal with time-consuming approvals. For 59% of budget-agile marketers, changes to digital budget of 20% or more take a week or longer for approval.8\nMarketers also face heavy oversight and scrutiny over budget changes and reallocations. Fifty-two percent of marketers say that executive or C-level individuals have a heavy influence on budget adjustments after the initial planning period.9\nFortunately, our research shows that companies don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes to become more budget agile. Even brands and agencies that invest in dedicated channel expertise and specialist teams can still achieve quick wins to drive better collaboration and results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to break down organizational silos. Fifty-eight percent of marketers have created more cross-channel team touchpoints, such as meetings, training, and information sharing to improve collaboration.10 And, compared to their non-agile peers, budget-agile marketers are twice as likely to call their marketing across channels \u201cvery tightly integrated.\u201d11\nThey\u2019re also leaning into their agency partnerships to stay on the cutting edge. Agencies can help encourage an agile mindset when it comes to budgeting and breaking down organizational silos.\nForty-two percent of budget-agile marketers say their agency partners greatly influence adjustments they make after initial budget planning, compared to only 31% of non-agile marketers.12\nNext, more teams are setting shared goals that allow them to take a results-first rather than a channel-first approach. This starts with implementing consistent measurement and success metrics that help marketers align on a common language, even when they work on different channels. In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed have instituted shared metrics and KPIs across channels to improve collaboration.13\nMarketers are also relying on Google AI to maximize budget agility across channels in real time. Budget-agile marketers are 29% more likely than non-agile marketers to use cross-channel automation.14\nOne example of this is demonstrated by the global streaming service Discovery+, which adopted Performance Max to improve how the brand optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. Regina Sommese, group vice president of paid media and global subscriber acquisitions at Discovery+, says, \u201cBeing budget fluid has always been critical for us, but the process has historically been manual. Performance Max allowed us to move away from managing siloed campaigns to one holistic optimization approach.\u201d\nAs global brands like Discovery+ have found, driving reliable results and creating a culture of experimentation don\u2019t have to be at odds. In fast-changing environments, marketers who can strike the right balance between investing in proven strategies and funding experiments that unlock new opportunities will deliver long-term growth. In fact, 31% of budget-agile marketers say it\u2019s \u201cvery easy\u201d to get additional budget to start new tests that weren\u2019t included in the initial media budget, compared to just 9% of non-agile marketers.15\nIn times of uncertainty, it can also be a natural instinct to become more conservative and pull back on marketing budgets. Only 17% of budget-agile marketers and 6% of non-agile marketers have channels with uncapped or unlimited budgets that make it easy to increase budgets for new opportunities.16\nInside Google\u2019s own marketing team, we\u2019re taking the exact opposite approach. We\u2019ve partnered with our finance teams to prove the incremental value of marketing by aligning marketing goals with real business outcomes, like profitability and customer lifetime value. We also reforecast our global budgets regularly to ensure that we can request more funds if we have room to scale successful tests against finance-approved ROI thresholds. This gives us greater freedom to avoid artificial \u201ccaps\u201d on digital media budgets that can limit our ability to improve results.\nAgile marketers help their teams move faster, pivot to take advantage of new performance opportunities, and ultimately drive more business growth. By finding the right balance across budget agility, cross-channel team collaboration, and experimentation, marketers can invest their resources more effectively to maximize ROI."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in advertising. Here, KR Liu, Google\u2019s head of brand accessibility, shares her personal story and why accessible marketing is critical for every brand.\nI am female, queer, and disabled. For much of my life, these parts of my identity were rarely, if ever, authentically represented in media and advertising. This made me feel different, unvalued, and alone. As a result, I spent more than a decade hiding who I was in my personal life and at work.\nThen, a few years ago, I began to recognize that each part of my identity was essential and that no one part could exist without the other. It was the first time I felt as though people cared about all of me, rather than only my disability. That feeling was transformative.\nSadly, many others can relate to my experience of not feeling fully seen and represented in society, or in brand advertising. Great ads should reflect everyone, including the 1 billion people worldwide who identify as disabled and control 8 trillion dollars in spending. They should also acknowledge intersectionality, because like me, every disabled person has many dimensions to their identity that make them, them.\nSource: The World Bank, Global, April 2022.\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a day job that focuses on improving the accessibility of Google\u2019s marketing for our billions of users. While accessibility has always been core to our company\u2019s mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 being truly accessible is a journey, and we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to improve, and we are hoping to help other brands improve too.\nA year ago, we shared Google.com/All-In, an inclusive marketing toolkit for brands and agencies. Today, I\u2019m excited to share that All In now includes an all-new playbook on accessible marketing, which we developed in partnership with LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN, and has been endorsed by the American Association of Ad Agencies, Ad Council, Cannes Lions, and many other leading organizations.\nThe playbook has meaningfully guided our marketing this past year, and is the result of yearslong research and collaboration across many accessibility topics \u2014 from web experience to authentic depictions of people with disabilities. We\u2019re sharing it publicly with the hope it will improve the representation of disabled people in the media and help create work that is fully accessible. And, here, I\u2019m sharing three core principles from the playbook, with hope that it will inspire you to visit All In to learn more.\nDisabled people are their own experts, which is why it\u2019s so important to bring in their voices from the start. Often this involves dedicating the resources required to do accessible marketing right, such as training and support for internal teams.\nFor many companies, this may also involve leaning on a specialized third party for guidance. At Google, we sought out partnerships with several experts in disability inclusion, including LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN. Partnerships like these allow you show allyship and engage directly with the disabled community, which helps to expand the ideas that fuel your work.\nFor marketing to feel truly inclusive and accessible, brands must think about people with disabilities holistically, and consider the full spectrum of markers that comprise identity. Beyond disability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education level are just a few of the additional ways that people may identify themselves.\nFailing to recognize and reflect intersectionality in your messages runs the risk of reducing disabled people\u2019s multidimensional identities into oversimplified stories that can perpetuate stereotypes, rather than uplifting them. An excellent rule of thumb is to always opt for nuanced narratives, preferably ones that come directly from the people who are part of the narrative.\nOne example of this is our campaign, \u201cA CODA Story,\u201d which shares the multigenerational personal experience of Tony Lee, an Asian American Googler and a child of deaf adults (CODA). The film portrays Lee and his family as they bridge gaps in distance and communication during the pandemic by using Google\u2019s assistive technologies.\nBest practices for disability inclusion and accessibility marketing change over time as technology evolves and culture shifts. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey that depends heavily on the needs of people with disabilities. Like other forms of inclusion, accessibility should be a constant commitment that\u2019s embedded into every aspect of your brand campaigns \u2014 from conception to execution, and beyond.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on accessible marketing, but we recognize that there\u2019s plenty of work ahead. Achieving our accessibility goals is a continual process, and we are perpetually learning from it.\nOne thing we\u2019ve proved over and over again is that accessibility and disability inclusive marketing are good for all people, and the benefits don\u2019t stop there. When everyone can fully access and engage with your products, content, and experiences, it\u2019s good for business. Brands that prioritize this concept as a human and business imperative will find that it opens up their work to a more diverse audience. Committing to accessibility in marketing breaks down barriers and enables brands to be better in their work, which is better for all users.\nTogether, we can drive a cultural shift that represents and celebrates people with disabilities as their whole selves. A world where everyone can see themselves is one where everyone has what they need to thrive."

        "output": "No\u00ebl Paasch, creative director at Google\u2019s Creative Works, leads brand and agency partnerships to determine best practices in advertising on YouTube. Here, she shares results from over two years of research to better understand the effectiveness of food, beverage, and restaurant video ads.\nShould your opening shot feature a satisfied customer enjoying your product mid-bite? Should it set the scene, steadily leading up to the product reveal?\nWhen it comes to creative decisions for video ads, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish pure aesthetics from what drives results. Without hard data, it\u2019s impossible to understand the psychology behind viewers\u2019 responses.\nOur ABCDs for creative effectiveness are data-informed, tested guidelines that can be applied universally to any video ad. In fact, Nielsen found that food, beverage, and restaurant ads that closely followed the ABCDs saw, on average, 31% higher sales lift.1 Supported by third-party research, our team recently conducted additional analyses to uncover more actionable creative insights around food ads. Here\u2019s what they found.\nThe experience of food is so much more than just its taste. A chocolate chip cookie is just as much its salty-sweet, fresh-from-the-oven smell, iconic craggy texture, and gooey chocolate melting on your fingers as it is its flavor. Our analysis shows that you can engage both sight and sound to make up for the lack of other sensory details.\nTake Magnum Ruby\u2019s ad, for example. When the protagonist takes a big bite of the chocolate-coated ice cream, the sound effect of the chocolate layer shattering evokes the experience of biting into a Magnum ice cream. Together, sight and sound are more compelling than either sense would be alone, summoning the memory of smell and taste.\nIt goes without saying that texture plays a big role in the characterization of any food. Would fresh pizza be as appealing without its gooey cheese or soft, bready crust?\nResearch shows that the majority of viewers watch ads on their mobile devices, so conveying the full visual through close-up shots of the product is extra important. Clear, crisp visuals help to communicate the product benefit quickly. This is generally good advice for any vertical on YouTube, but especially for food, beverage, and restaurant brands.\nC\u00f4te d'Or used this technique to great effect in their holiday ad. In each shot of the product, the chocolate takes up the full screen. The sheen of its smooth exterior and the grooves of the nut filling are so vivid, the viewer may as well have the product in front of them.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much one ad can show of the product itself. With limited time, shorter-form ads are perfect for focusing solely on the product, but studies show that long-form ads are more effective when they incorporate a human story. Introducing a human element adds context and makes it easier for the viewer to relate.\nIHop\u2019s \u201cAll You Can Eat Pancakes\u201d campaign included both a short-form and long-form video ad. The 6-second ad featured a single shot of the food itself, while the 15-second ad took advantage of those extra seconds by featuring three different people. No character is shown eating; we don\u2019t even get to see their faces. Yet the actors lend a human touch to the ad. Despite the age-old advice that every food ad needs a bite-and-smile moment, our analysis showed that a range of scenarios performed equally well, from ads that put chewing front-and-center to those in which no one actually ate.\nTry experimenting with varied ad lengths and creative executions to see what performs best with your brand and audiences.\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales lift, the memorability of your brand is as important as the food itself. And when it comes to brand expression, you should pull out all the stops.\nOur research shows that relying on a logo endcard might not be doing the most work for you. To make a lasting impression, think about seamlessly incorporating it throughout the ad, complemented by audio mentions, large type supers, and distinctive brand assets like mascots, brand colors, and mnemonics.\nThis Coca-Cola Vanilla ad does a great job of both subtly and not-so-subtly integrating the brand into all 20 seconds of video. The more your brand appears in the ad spot, the more likely viewers are to remember it.\nLastly, remember that the average viewer\u2019s brain can only retain so much information from any given ad. So when it comes to copy, our data supports using clear, accessible language.\nFor example, try describing the benefit rather than the ingredient. BelVita\u2019s breakfast biscuits are \u201cloaded with energy,\u201d while Special K\u2019s cereal is \u201cfeeding strength to power your moves.\u201d Special K takes the technique a step further by showing how the product helps active people, such as dancers, in their day-to-day lives.\nArmed with these five insights, your team can measurably increase creative effectiveness, making your products and your bottom line even more appetizing. Still, the best way to determine which creative practices support your goals, from awareness to conversion, is to experiment with your own ads and test them yourself."

        "output": "Today, people are spending more time online, and there\u2019s a growing challenge to hold their attention when they land on your site. When you do have their attention, it\u2019s even harder to capture their lead information. Landing pages aren\u2019t always the most popular sign-up forms, but they have the potential to accelerate your lead-generation efforts through effective design, copy, and prospect-acquisition strategy.\nWell-optimized website landing pages should convert prospects into leads. Think of it this way: Your website is like a storefront. A good landing page is a storefront window that welcomes customers by eliminating confusion and improving discoverability. Ultimately, it should convert prospective customers into solid leads.\nAt HubSpot, I\u2019ve worked with many brands over the years to optimize landing pages that deliver results. Here are four principles we use to increase lead generation.\nTo encourage the highest-quality results, landing pages should easily and quickly communicate the value of an offer \u2014 whether it\u2019s a guide, a set of templates, or a virtual event like a webinar. Be clear and avoid jargon. A well-built landing page should tell the audience what they should give in exchange for the content, how it will help solve their problem, and what exactly they\u2019ll get in return. The first impression that your customers will have of your company will come from your landing page, so it\u2019s important to think about your typical customers\u2019 fears and pain points. Be transparent by providing clear, comprehensive information up front \u2014 especially when it comes to factors such as additional fees, which may turn prospects away.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is worth a million. Adding compelling imagery and videos to landing pages helps grab attention and can help improve conversion rates. According to a HubSpot study on landing pages, 30% of top landing pages feature video content. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that imagery should be relevant and enhance the call to action (CTA), instead of driving added confusion.\nThe goal of a landing page is to have prospects hand over the desired information in exchange for the content or offer. Navigation of the page should be kept to a minimum and coupled with a clearly presented CTA to help customers quickly see the value in the page\u2019s offer and products. An action like \u201cDownload\u201d, \u201cSign up\u201d, or an otherwise relevant CTA at the top, middle, and bottom of the landing page can ratchet up more conversions because audiences don\u2019t have to go searching for the next step. Consider a personalized CTA, or smart CTA, which can convert 202% better than default versions.\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s marketing benchmarks report, companies see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. Successful landing page strategies have different pages to target specific audiences depending on where they clicked through from, and they keep each audience\u2019s motivators in mind through the entire page design. Improving relevance for your landing pages with different audiences can also lead to improved ad positioning \u2014 the better the experience your pages provide, the more likely your ads will show up in a higher position. One way to optimize your landing-page audience strategy is with Google Ads campaigns from Google and HubSpot. You can see how your leads perform by measuring key actions in the lead-to-sale journey, importing your offline conversions to understand the full value of the lead, and then using Customer Match to create personalized, meaningful landing page messages for different segments of those leads.

        "output": "The marketing industry is entering a new golden age of opportunities, spurred by an unlikely catalyst: third-party cookies.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, industry leaders are making great strides to develop their \u201ccreative intelligence\u201d to reach and engage customers. Creative intelligence can be understood as the ability to customize creative without using third-party data, and then deliver these ads using the latest technologies to reach the right audiences, with the right messages, at the right times. The creative feel relevant and engaging, without the need for any personal data.\nAs we prepare for this new era in a so-called \u201ccookie-less world,\u201d here are three steps organizations can take now to build a privacy-safe creative strategy.\nMarketers must shift away from personalized ads toward a new, future-proof approach. The industry is on the cusp of a \u201ccontextual ads\u201d renaissance; these are ads that can be customized based on easily accessible information \u2014 like the date, time, weather, and even traffic conditions. This information is referred to as \u201ccontextual\u201d data, and it\u2019s been around for years but is often overlooked. These data points can play a huge role in helping marketers craft creative that is relevant and unobtrusive.\nContextual signals available to marketers\nBelgian windshield repair company Carglass recently used this privacy-forward approach to deliver customized video ads that drove impact. The firm delivered ads by using a combination of real-time data \u2014 including the weather and the streaming program a person was watching \u2014 along with first-party data about car ownership status. Contextual data about the user\u2019s country and language preference were also added into the mix. With all these data points, the company was able to serve individual viewers automated ads that were customized for the situation.\nFor example, a French speaker in Brussels watching a funny sitcom who had previously inquired about minor damage to their rear window would be served an upbeat advertisement in French, featuring rear windshield replacement and details about the Carglass service centers closest to them.\nThe ads led to an 89% drop in view-through conversion costs and drove bookings at a low cost per acquisition.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, marketers can adapt to this new creative context by drawing from a base of contextual signals, then adding in first-party data to segment audiences. Marketing teams can then go a step further by introducing statistical models to refine the clustering of audiences and predict future behavior. This allows teams to more effectively deliver relevant ads to the right audiences.\nCreative is sometimes a neglected area of marketing strategy, considered secondary to media buying and ad tech. However, Forrester research shows that shifting marketing budget from technology to creative resources can improve return on investment by up to 18%.\nTo tap into this growth potential, marketers will require both creative investment along with automation. Automated solutions can shuffle up creative assets to deliver highly relevant ads to potential customers, while saving teams precious time and energy.\nEuropean beauty retailer Douglas recently demonstrated how creative and automation can work together to deliver effective, customized ads. The company set up a campaign to reach website visitors who had provided their first-party data, and also included a wider audience of like-minded people by harnessing Google\u2019s Affinity Audiences. From there, Douglas used contextual signals to deliver ads to online pages their audiences were viewing, but they featured ads only on pages that included specific keywords.\nThe beauty of this campaign was that the company delivered these ads with automated, customized creative. People who were considered \u201chigh-potential\u201d and more likely to invest in premium products \u2014 based on first-party data and the pages they visited \u2014 were shown relevant ads for high-end beauty brands and products. Douglas aimed to improve the average order value of these loyal customers. Other audience members were shown ads aligned with their interests in either makeup, perfume, or skin care, and the featured products had lower prices. The creative assets and products were automatically swapped around to make the ads feel deeply relevant to customers.\nExample of makeup ad (left) and premium ad (right) from Douglas\nTwo animated ads for beauty products from Douglas cycle through images of a white woman modeling the nail polish, moisturizer, bronzer, blush, and anti-aging products featured.\nCreative workflows need updating in this new era. Teams need to move from a linear process to a continuous feedback loop.\nContinuous feedback loop\nThis creative workflow process involves creating dynamic ad templates where creative elements can be added and combined according to live signals, in real time. Then technologies such as Cloud Vision API can analyze visual elements and identify which approaches work best, for example, showing a person in an ad or simply showing the product. With some experimentation and testing, customer insights will build over time and new creative elements can be added into the mix and used in the ad templates. It\u2019s all about continuous, automated improvements to create the most relevant ads.\nA recent report from BCG outlines that a major airline took this approach and built a \u201cdynamic content factory.\u201d The team added between 20 to 40 new creative elements every week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, it had thousands of pieces of content to deploy using artificial intelligence into dynamic templates that combined email, web, and paid channels,\u201d said the BCG report authors.\nLuxury perfume and cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me used this approach as well, with ads built upon a dynamic template and creative assets that were automatically swapped around for improved audience appeal. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand used a continuous feedback loop to update the creative assets based on new customer insights, and these ads ultimately delivered a 31% higher click-through rate compared to static Lanc\u00f4me ads.\nThe dynamic creative were \u201ca great opportunity for our in-house programmatic team to generate actionable consumer insights,\u201d said L\u2019Or\u00e9al Germany\u2019s Head of Precision Marketing Nadine Kamski.\nThis shift toward new creative processes and away from third-party cookies could lead marketers to focus on new metrics to measure their success. While key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates are essential right now, other metrics could become more prevalent in the future. For example, engagement rates, brand lift, and return on investment could become the new standards to measure success.\nThe power of creative marketing is only set to increase, alongside the use of smart automation, as the marketing world transitions to a new privacy-first future.\n\u200b\u200b\u201dThere\u2019s so much to explore on our journey to using data creatively,\u201d says Di Mayze, global head of data at WPP. \u201cCurious data people will drive new kinds of innovation and creativity that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nWhen rethinking your brand\u2019s creative strategy, here are some points to consider."

        "output": "Brands know that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply influence perception. To be ready for what\u2019s next, they need ads to drive action.\nTo explore this, Google partnered with Global Citizen to challenge ten world-class creative and performance agencies with a brief of global importance: mobilize individuals to take action for a better world using direct response ad formats across Google and YouTube.\nWorking together, agencies around the world used Video action campaigns with Discovery ads to inspire action on social challenges across health, inequality, sustainability, and education. The campaigns drove tens of thousands of people around the world to sign up as Global Citizens \u2013 a 220% increase on the average \u2013 resulting in one of Global Citizen\u2019s most successful digital acquisition campaigns, ever.Their journey uncovered 5 takeaways to get brands ready for what\u2019s next.\nTo get viewers to act, make action the center of the concept, versus relying on a call-to-action at the end. Protect the Planet leverages ASMR sound effects, visceral immediacy, and a CTA of \u201cStop this\u201d that progressively reveals throughout the ad to trigger viewer action, which resulted in strong click-through rates. Meanwhile, Advance Equity for All pairs an emotionally driven narrative with a YouTube best practice of breaking the fourth wall to deliver high average watch time and conversions per clickthrough.\nFrom striking visuals to emotional appeals, all campaigns experimented with making action integral to the storyline \u2013 driving record conversions for Global Citizen.\nSrinivas Seshadri, Director, Performance Marketing, Interactive Avenues India (End The Hunger Crisis)\nCombining YouTube and Google ad formats in an action-driving campaign can produce more efficient results than using one ad format alone. Each agency developed incredible action-driven Video action campaigns, but when paired with Discovery ads, the campaigns collectively resulted in 28% lower average conversion costs.Creating for multiple formats doesn't have to be complex. You can simply lift stills from your video asset and use them as images in Discovery ads alongside minimal copy and a succinct CTA. For all campaigns, agencies employed this approach to drive more efficient conversions.\nGeane Mota, Executive Director, Client Solutions, Blinks Essence (End Covid For All)\nGetting your audience\u2019s attention \u2014 and holding on to it \u2014 means you have more opportunity to educate, engage, or inspire. A more informed viewer is more likely to click and convert.\nAdvance Equity for All\u2019s impressive click-to-conversion ratio indicated that the longer audiences watched, the more likely they were to click through. So, grab the viewer's attention, then make sure you use it.\nWhether crafting awareness or action campaigns, the principles of YouTube's ABCD framework and Google Ads best practices remain vital. Attracting attention quickly, integrating brand throughout, and authentically connecting with audiences is essential, no matter the campaign. Once you have the attention of the viewer, be direct. Tell them what you want them to do, and show them how to do it. Campaigns with people-focused creative that address the viewer directly, like End Covid For All, perform well.\nAsking audiences to take action only works once they\u2019re already paying attention. So brands need to make sure they\u2019re making use of best practices in order to make that happen.\nChloe Stephenson, Creative Director, BBH London (Resume Learning)\nThe consumer journey is not linear, meaning that brands and agencies cannot operate in silos of creative and performance. To drive more effective and efficient campaigns, brands must break down these barriers.\nAll creative and performance agencies working on the Global Citizen campaigns partnered from the brief, through creative ideation to execution. Working collaboratively enabled campaign efficiencies and ensured all touchpoints across the customer journey were truly integrated.\nAbi Howson, VP, Video, Jellyfish UK (Resume Learning)\nWhether brands are trying to change the world or drive business results, direct response ad formats on YouTube and Google have the power to share stories that drive real action. Brands that harness the power of data-driven creativity won\u2019t only be ready for what\u2019s next \u2014 they\u2019ll be shaping what next looks like.\nWatch all the campaigns.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio.

        "input": "",
        "output": "One of the best parts of working at YouTube is being part of the creator economy and enabling next-generation media companies to make the innovative content people love. Just last week, we announced that over the past three years, YouTube has paid $50 billion to fuel the creator economy. It\u2019s inspiring to see how these entrepreneurs are growing their audiences and businesses, while also experimenting with new tools and formats.\nTake Cassey Ho, for example. You might know her better as Blogilates, the world\u2019s most-watched Pilates instructor, who has made Pilates and wellness accessible to millions of people for more than a decade. During that time, she also became the CEO and lead designer of her own activewear company. And over the past year, she started using YouTube Shorts to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at her design process, and to share fitness tips, quick recipe ideas, and more. She does this all while continuing to post long-form workout videos daily.\nHo\u2019s willingness to innovate and embrace new formats in creative ways makes her beloved by millions. By adapting her content to be multiformat, she\u2019s also demonstrating a deep understanding of how viewers discover and watch videos today.\nThat\u2019s because people now move seamlessly between screens, experiencing worlds of content made of what they love, fueled by creators who are experts in what\u2019s relevant. In fact, streaming across different screens, video lengths, and creators is at an all-time high. Whether the content is long, short, mainstream, or personal, YouTube is the one place where people watch it all.\nHow can brands ensure that they are taking full advantage of a multiformat approach? Here are three key things to do.\nYou\u2019ve seen the dances. You\u2019ve heard the viral audio samples. And you\u2019ve probably been fooled by a \u201ccake or fake?\u201d clip at least once. If video is the breakout medium of the past few years, then mobile short-form vertical video is the breakout format. What\u2019s one thing all those short videos have in common? Creators who are constantly shaping and reacting to trends. Viewers can\u2019t get enough of them.\nSince its launch in 2021, YouTube Shorts is now home to 1.5 billion monthly active users and earns more than 30 billion daily views.1 While it\u2019s a mobile destination, Shorts also fuels discovery across formats and screens. Creators who upload both long-form video and Shorts on YouTube see longer overall watch time and subscriber growth. According to YouTube\u2019s latest Culture & Trends Report, 59% of Gen Z \u2014 the world\u2019s largest generation \u2014 agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nWhile viewers favor their mobile devices for short-form vertical video, they\u2019re increasingly turning to another familiar place for long-form online video from their favorite creators. In fact, TV is YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing screen today, with watch time continuing to level up. As of January 2022, on average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.3 The growing popularity of connected devices tells us that the old distinctions between network TV, digital, streaming, and mobile video are fading.\nSome of the shortest videos on YouTube last only a second or two, whereas the longest video on YouTube right now would take you about eight days to watch. Seriously. So what\u2019s the perfect length and type of content to keep viewers engaged?\nWe\u2019ve spent years studying and refining best practices for effective storytelling via short-form and long-form content on YouTube, exploring what makes content \u201cgood,\u201d and defining the ABCDs of effective YouTube creative. We also look to creators. Since the earliest days of video sharing on the internet, they\u2019ve experimented and optimized the length of their videos to find the sweet spot of audience attention. Because of this, they\u2019re a strong indicator of what works on YouTube.\nRight now, creators of all popularity levels are using short-form video as the latest space to experiment with new approaches and engage viewers. South Korean girl band Blackpink, for example, created the #PinkVenomChallenge on Shorts to promote the release of their latest music video, \u201cPink Venom.\u201d The group\u2019s multiformat marketing approach helped them set a new YouTube record: Pink Venom garnered 90.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the third-biggest 24-hour music video debut of all time.\nOther creators like fitness instructor GrowWithJo and dermatologist Dr. Dray have discovered that Shorts help them expand their existing YouTube channel audience and balance out their long-form content. GrowWithJo shares quick workout tips and tutorials on Shorts, inspiring viewers to also check out her long-form exercise videos. Meanwhile, Dr. Dray complements her in-depth skin care content with Shorts that offer bite-sized advice, such as quick answers to questions like \u201cWhat age to start retinoid?\u201d\nAnother way creators experiment is by giving their Shorts a distinctive style that stands out from other video formats. They might use built-in effects and filters, try different editing styles, or add popular audio samples. On top of this, they tend to use short-form video to capture content that\u2019s emotional in nature, whether delivering joy, high drama, or laughter.\nAll of this experimentation with short-form video makes creators an excellent resource for actionable Shorts-related tips. We often look to creators\u2019 learnings and insights when developing tools, templates, and creative best practices for making vertical video ads on YouTube. Here are some of our favorite creator tips for building successful Shorts.\nAs brands take inspiration from creators and experiment with short-form vertical video, they should keep in mind other creative considerations and the availability of automated tools and templates that make video ad creation easy.\nTo take advantage of this new evolution in content and user experience, marketers should think more expansively about their video campaigns and build for a range of ad lengths and screens. They can use this opportunity to break from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video ads by, instead, adapting creative assets to the look and vibe of the ad environment, whether it\u2019s in-depth, long-form video or casual, short vertical videos.\nThis combination of video ad formats is a recipe for success on YouTube. After all, adding vertical video to the mix gives brands a new creative canvas to tell their story and expand their multiformat strategy on YouTube, which helps drive the results they care about. Plus, Shorts can help brands show up alongside culturally relevant, creator-driven content that viewers love.\nMarketers should also use Shorts as a new way to achieve lower-funnel campaign goals. Because YouTube is a source of inspiration along the shopping journey, short-form video can easily help turn viewers into customers. And brands can now add vertical video assets to Video action, App, and Performance Max campaigns, which automatically scale to Shorts. Early testing shows that adding a vertical video asset to Video action campaigns delivers 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts compared to landscape videos alone.4\nCreators have been at the forefront of multiformat content experimentation, and have seen their YouTube presence and viewership grow exponentially as a result. Marketers can find similar success by studying how people move from screen to screen to watch different video formats, following creators\u2019 tips on how to engage audiences with Shorts, and using multiformat content to drive results across the entire funnel."

        "output": "Elizaveta Orekhovskaya and Artem Ryzhenkov, video advertising managers at global SaaS company Semrush, share the step-by-step plan behind their company\u2019s initiative to increase conversions with no additional budget.\nAt this stage of the pandemic, everyone is familiar with the laundry list of challenges faced by companies around the world: nervous customers, employee churn, supply-chain bottlenecks, and so on. Like the COVID-19 variants themselves, these challenges continue to take new forms with sometimes uncertain consequences.\nIn 2022, with many small- to mid-sized brands embracing digital advertising strategies for the first time, one key challenge is to break through the noise created by this shift in consumer behaviors and subsequent marketing activity.\nAt Semrush, where our business is to help brands manage their visibility on the internet, we faced this very problem as we set out to promote our own niche product with a complex funnel.\nOur customers use the Semrush platform to optimize search engine results and market more effectively online. Our platform simplifies content creation, social media, campaign creation, and competitive intelligence. Our primary goal with our most recent digital marketing initiative was to increase conversions with no additional budget. Here\u2019s how we did it.\nWe started out by investing in search and display traffic. Using keyword-based targeting, we identified an audience of users who were in-market for our product and began \u201cwarming up\u201d these potential customers with display visuals.\nThen we sought new media environments where we could drive performance without going over budget. We chose YouTube as one of these channels, given video\u2019s proven ability to create a story about a product. Our marketing team had tried YouTube before, but as we will see in a moment, its results left something to be desired.\nInitially, we set up our YouTube campaigns manually, rather than automating them. We did this mostly to understand the available optimization metrics. We launched a number of videos and analyzed them based on cost per impression, cost per view, cost per click, and click-through rate. With this knowledge in hand, our team began automating campaigns using performance metrics, such as cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate.\nThe next step was to develop a system for conversion and attribution tracking. Whereas we had previously attributed most ad conversions based on the click alone, we now added view-based attribution of YouTube ads using Google Campaign Manager.\nWith this change, YouTube\u2019s provable value as an ad channel \u2014 particularly at the customer attraction stage \u2014 was far more clear. And these placements assumed privilege of place among our other paid channels.\nOur team then tested every possible audience type, ad format, and bidding strategy. We found that custom audiences worked better for promoting a specific product than it did for a generic brand. In cases with frequently fluctuating budgets and long conversion funnels, a Maximize conversion bidding strategy proved more effective than a Target CPA strategy. And we settled on the skippable in-stream ad as the most effective ad format for its product.\nOnce the preliminary results were available, we set out to optimize our ad creatives and landing pages.\nOlga Denisova, our VP for digital marketing, observed that a better conversion rate at each stage is achieved by having videos of a certain duration, type of content, degree of complexity, and format \u2014 that is, animated or with human actors.\nFor example, at the upper stages of the funnel, we used short videos of up to 15 seconds that featured the product and encouraged trials. For lower-funnel marketing, we presented lengthier videos \u2014 up to a minute long \u2014 with more detail about a specific product feature or customer success story.\nBased on this insight, Denisova and her team began optimizing our video creatives according to the audience\u2019s phase of purchase consideration.\nOur earlier video creatives had basic graphics with lots of text but lacked voice-over and dynamism.\nWe corrected this in newer videos, focusing on more striking visuals with human actors. The CTA was also reworked for different stages of the funnel, and the video duration was optimized.\nOnce we had worked out our optimal YouTube ads settings, we set out to scale up the Semrush channel.\nBased on past experience, we introduced an optimal frequency of seven impressions per day and 10 views per month.\nFor remarketing campaigns, we based our learning strategy on the size of the targeted audience. In the upper remarketing funnel, with its large available audience of website visitors and registered users, we deployed Google\u2019s Maximize conversions bidding strategy. The lower stages of the funnel were optimized for cost per view, since the smaller available audience meant machine-learning strategies were less powerful.\nIt became clear over the course of this campaign that YouTube advertising not only delivered conversions directly, but also contributed to an increase in paid and organic search results. We saw interest in Semrush in the U.S. grow by an average of 72.6% during a Brand Lift study conducted in May 2021, while interest in our Keyword Magic Tool grew by 120.4%. Another video ad campaign in Canada delivered an increase in paid and organic Google search results of 521%.\nSince the pandemic restricted our ability to produce new video assets, we needed to improve our conversion metrics without increasing our budget or the number of video creatives we produced. To achieve this, our team used a new format from Google called Video Action campaigns, designed to drive lower funnel actions such as website clicks and conversions. As a result, the range of our ads expanded, their variability increased, and automated strategies began learning better from the increased number of conversions.\nIn Video Action campaign ads, we found the ideal palette for our new ad creatives. In one A/B test, a combination of skippable in-stream ads and Video Action campaign ads went up against skippable in-stream ads only. The combined strategy clearly performed better.\nOur CPA at the lowest stage of the funnel was 55% lower than that of the in-stream-only campaign. The cost per sign-up also fell 51%. Video Action campaigns cost 91% less, and view-through rates were 3% higher, than in-stream.\nAfter Video Action proved itself to be the superior strategy, not only on the basis of conversion but also in upper-funnel metrics, we launched the format in all automated strategy campaigns. This helped reduce the CPA per purchase from YouTube ads by a whopping 11%."

Today\u2019s auto brands face a crowded and competitive landscape, demanding more inventiveness. Producing an ad that really connects with the viewer can be a challenge. Creative is one tool you can leverage to make significant differences in ROI, and experimenting makes it easy to adapt and update campaigns at scale.\nTo find out what makes auto ads effective, our team analyzed thousands of auto ads on YouTube to better understand what drove performance. Based on our findings, we determined that these five creative strategies set the most successful ads apart.\nWhen it comes to the first few seconds of an auto ad, put the pedal to the metal. Opt for dropping viewers right into the action to hook their attention, over the more traditional wide running car footage they\u2019re used to seeing. From there, introduce dynamism with quickly paced, contrasting visuals paired with audio and supers.\nThe Cupra Born spot kicks off with a flash of a speeding car and keeps the momentum going by interspersing clips of the car with fleeting shots of engaging visuals to evoke the energy and excitement of being behind the wheel. The fast pace and rapid-fire stimuli grip the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them engaged throughout the ad.\nFacts and specs are important, but they\u2019re not the only things that work to sell a car. Anchoring your story in human experience allows your audience to imagine the tangible experience of the car, and how it might fit into their lives, building a personal, and more powerful, connection to your brand.\nMitsubishi Brazil\u2019s New Generation spot features women from all backgrounds literally and figuratively taking the wheel, including the wheel of a powerful new four-wheel drive. Multiple characters and a powerful storyline give viewers a reason to connect and emotionally invest.\nEngines revving, brakes squealing, tires hitting the ground: These familiar sounds create an immersive experience for viewers, an experience that becomes critical on YouTube, where 95% of ads are played with the sound on.1 Sound effects, voice-over, and other audio elements have been shown to engage people\u2019s attention and help them imagine what it\u2019s like to drive a particular car \u2014 an important consideration for purchase.\nMini USA\u2019s Hardtop 2-Door Hatchback spot amplifies the sound of the engine throughout the ad alongside everyday dialogue and a fun music track, bringing the full driving experience to life in an immersive and relatable way.\nEvery spot is a chance to show off the specs and features that make your car stand out from the rest, and simplicity is key. Ads shorter than 15 seconds are better served by focusing on one or two things, whereas longer ads have more wiggle room. The key is to keep it clear and not force too many messages at once. Have a lot to say? Consider experimenting by breaking up your multifeature spot with several shorter single-feature ads.\nFord US\u2019s F-150 campaign highlights two key features centered around one idea: making work accessible and easy, both inside and out, when you\u2019re on the road. The message is clear and simple, giving these standout features their chance to shine.\nMore than 70% of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices globally,2 so making your ad viewable on a 5-inch screen is a minimum requirement. Think bright, high-contrast colors, tight framing, and large-type supers to make your ad stand out on that small screen. \u201cBut will that translate to TV?\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve seen that mobile-first ads work just as well on connected TVs.3\nVolkswagen Canada uses bright colors and tight shots of their cars paired with large-type supers that add playful taglines to their fleet of SUVWs, ensuring that the ad is not only eye-catching, but memorable.\nUse these five data-backed creative strategies as a starting point for your next auto ad. Each tactic leaves plenty of room for your brand\u2019s unique sensibility. And once you have a strong foundation, try experimenting with different iterations of your creative to see what works best for your specific audience."

        "output": "Each year, the YouTube Works Awards program partners with Kantar to celebrate the most innovative and effective YouTube advertising in the industry. 2021 presented unique creative challenges as marketers faced the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, digital privacy concerns, and new privacy regulations. Undeterred, the brands with the six winning campaigns produced fresh, groundbreaking ideas that masterfully combined creative storytelling and YouTube. \u201cIn years past, there have been some category winners that were just brilliant video. When I look across this year\u2019s winners, everyone innovated and used the platform,\u201d said judge Colleen Leddy, chief engagement officer at Droga5.\nLet\u2019s look at four major takeaways from our winning campaigns and how they ingeniously used YouTube to drive impressive business results.\nBLK, a dating app for Gen Z and young millennials in the Black community, wanted its users to go from online connections to safe, real-life interactions. However, the COVID-19 health crisis still loomed and the COVID-19 vaccine remained a point of contention in the Black community. BLK decided to tap into Gen Z and young millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for streaming music to encourage its audience to get the vaccine. The brand launched a music video on YouTube called \u201cVax That Thang Up,\u201d which was inspired by a classic hip-hop song.\nThough the video stood at roughly two minutes in length and could be skipped, it still received over 3 billion media impressions in the first day. New registrations on the BLK app increased by 30% week over week, and first-time paid subscribers grew by 22% week over week. \u201cThey leveraged skippable and made you engaged enough to not want to skip,\u201d marveled one of our judges.\nIn contrast to BLK\u2019s longer content, travel metasearch site Kayak used quick, 15-seconds-or-less videos to address the effects of COVID-19 on travel. Using its own research and Google Trends, Kayak discovered that, even though many travel restrictions were still in place, Americans actually wanted to travel but needed the reassurance of more flexibility and options when booking trips. In response, Kayak created multiple campaigns that highlighted free cancellation and encouraged viewers to \u201cskip town\u201d instead of hitting the \u201cskip ad\u201d button.\nThe campaign proved a huge success, driving incremental conversion rates as high as 7.5% and raising purchase intent by 20%. John Deschner from Maximum Effort was impressed: \u201cThey helped you get over travel hesitancy in different ways and targeted people that were searching for these things.\u201d\nBlendJet, a blender company with a mission to make healthy food fast, easily appealed to women 24 to 54 years old, but knew it could reach a wider audience. For the launch of its new blender, the brand created a fun, out-of-the-ordinary campaign, which tapped into two wildly popular YouTube trends: \u201coddly satisfying videos\u201d and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). BlendJet\u2019s campaign, called \u201cOddly Satisfying ASMR Blends in a BlendJet 2 Portable Blender,\u201d featured a voice-over whispering clever statements while the blender hypnotically pulverized entire heads of cauliflower, chunks of ice, and more. To make sure this campaign would be seen by people most likely to buy its blenders, BlendJet focused on a custom intent audience segment, using its top converting keywords in Google Search.\nViewers ate it up. The video became a viral sensation that generated millions of dollars in sales. As a result, BlendJet\u2019s return on ad spend grew 569% year over year, and its revenue surpassed its initial target by 413%. Amanda Richman, CEO of Mindshare, praised BlendJet for turning a product demo into \u201csomething so different through the voice-over, the copy. They created content that is spot on for YouTube viewing.\u201d\nNew to the U.S. market, cat food brand Sheba needed an impactful campaign that would resonate with American cat parents. During its research, the brand discovered that cats often woke up their owners at unreasonable hours, like at four in the morning. Google Search data and YouTube analytics showed Sheba that roughly 1 in 3 people turned to their mobile phones during these moments. So Sheba created a soothing, five-hour video that used scientifically proven techniques to get people back to sleep. To promote the video during the day, Sheba released \u201csubliminal\u201d bumper ads. At night, it launched TrueView for action ads that were tailored to people\u2019s middle-of-the-night viewing habits on YouTube. A simple call to action in the ads would then lead tired cat parents to Sheba\u2019s sleep video.\nThe campaign resulted in a 100.9% uplift in brand recall and a 635% increase in searches for Sheba brand terms among those who had been exposed to the campaign. \u201cIt really was the best use of creative and media that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Traci Spiegelman, VP of global media at Mastercard. \u201cWhen you have a good insight, and find the right creative and media approach, you nail it.\u201d\nOnline dating app Tinder wanted to help the bisexual and bi+ community get more recognition and own the narrative around what it means to be bi+. It launched \u201cOnce Upon a Bi,\u201d a campaign that featured YouTube Creators reimagining well-known fairy tales based on the bi+ community\u2019s experience within the Tinder app. The brand then used TrueView for action to focus the campaign on affinity audience categories that overlapped with the creators\u2019 audiences.\nThe campaign received 3.2 million impressions, 2 million video views, and an average view rate that was 9% stronger than Tinder\u2019s previous campaign. \u201cTaking stories that have been passed on for generations and showing how they reinforce stereotypes, and using influencers and creators to tell the story was a really good use of YouTube,\u201d said Sheryl Goldstein, EVP, chief industry growth officer at IAB.\nDepartment store Target also partnered with a YouTube Creator to help diverse communities share their own stories. \u201cConvos with CEOs,\u201d a video series moderated by creator Hallease, centered on the entrepreneurial journeys of the Black-owned business founders whose products are in Target stores. Along with using paid media, Target promoted the campaign organically on YouTube by posting customer teaser content on its brand channel and publishing a playlist for the series.\nThe campaign garnered over 6.4 million views across all of the videos, over 107,000 hours of watch time, and over 20,000 total engagements on YouTube. \u201cThose convos were really rich and did the job that an ad could not have done,\u201d said Britt Nolan, president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett.\nIn a tough year, YouTube Works Awards winners turned hurdles into inspiration, reimagined content people already loved, appealed to their audiences 24/7, and gave the stage to diverse communities. They proved that a winning combination of clever storytelling and the YouTube platform can produce both viral sensations and enviable business results."

Here she explains how YouTube factors into consumers\u2019 shopping journeys.\nThe other day, my hair dryer broke.\nRather than immediately go to the store to buy a replacement, I decided to go online. I started with a simple YouTube search: \u201chow to blow dry long hair.\u201d But an interesting thing happened on my journey across the internet. I found new, related products I didn\u2019t even know existed. And, what do you know, instead of just buying a hair dryer, I bought the whole suite of products.\nFinding surprising products in a brick-and-mortar store is, or used to be, a common experience: that magical shopping moment when you stumble across something new that fits your needs perfectly. But this time, it happened in the world\u2019s biggest video storefront: YouTube.\nThe idea that e-commerce would evolve 10 years in six months started spreading during the pandemic. And while variations circulated around the industry, the concept is proving to be true: In 2020 alone, e-commerce grew nearly 30% worldwide.1\nThis summer, Publicis Groupe partnered with YouTube and Talk Shoppe to understand how the shopping journey has changed, and how brands can help enhance and expand people\u2019s experiences online. Here\u2019s what we found.\nSeventy-five percent of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration.2 This is because people have a shopping discovery mindset when they\u2019re watching video \u2014 and, of course, because there\u2019s so much content out there for them to discover.\nDue to the personalized experience of YouTube, they\u2019re not finding noise, but things that make their experiences and their lives better. For example, average daily uploads of videos with \u201cShop With Me\u201d in the title increased by over 60%, year over year.3\nYouTube is the matchmaker shoppers and brands have always wanted. You never know when a new shopping journey will begin. Importantly, this inspiration results in bigger shopping carts and upsells. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they can make a decision to purchase or not purchase faster.4\nCreators are the heart and soul of YouTube and the most tailored, personalized, shopping confidant someone could have. They are hybrids of a personal assistant and best friend, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.5\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 2021.\nWhen quality information is paired with authenticity, shoppers make confident decisions quicker, instead of leaving items in their cart while they weigh their options.\nMy daughter got me hooked on Emma Chamberlain. Twice, recently, we purchased something after watching her content. Social proof is powerful, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give them the best information about products and brands.6\nOf course, not everyone follows YouTube creators, but they can still find help on YouTube along their shopping journey. For these people, creator content is incredibly valuable, because the breadth, depth, and searchability means shoppers can find high-quality information. It\u2019s similar to reviews or star ratings on marketplaces. YouTube is a one-stop shop for the curious consumer.\nFor example, thrifting haul videos, a subset of the ever-popular haul format, in which creators share purchases that they\u2019ve made, have been viewed over 100 million times.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that YouTube\u2019s appeal as a shopping platform comes in exactly the place where brands can sometimes feel uncomfortable: It\u2019s all creator-driven, vast, and not always easy to wrap our minds around.\nResearch has repeatedly shown us that the quality of information matters more to shoppers than production quality. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they get the highest quality information about products.7\nWhen I think about these insights, I see opportunities everywhere: opportunities for brands to grow through partnering with creators; opportunities for platforms like YouTube to evolve and meet shopper needs; and opportunities to connect in new ways.\nOnline shopping is a whole new ballgame. And brands and advertisers need to adapt in this new world if they want to win big."

        "output": "As marketers, we share a common goal: Convince people to engage with our brands. Truth be told, it can take a lot of work to make this happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always struck by YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard, an annual list of the most-watched video ads of the year. In a world of unlimited content, millions of people actually choose to watch these ads, so it\u2019s useful to consider what makes them so successful.\nWhile no single formula exists for a viral video ad, we can make observations about what works to inspire our own media strategies. Here are three proven approaches to try, pulled from the latest Ads Leaderboard.\nFor its \u201cHarry Potter\u201d 20th anniversary special, HBO Max wanted to reach two distinct audiences: die-hard \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans eager to be reintroduced to the magic of the series and a new generation of younger viewers who hadn\u2019t yet embraced the franchise.\nTo appeal to both groups, HBO Max leaned into a powerful trend: people like watching content that makes them feel nostalgic. With that trend in mind, the brand designed a video ad to give viewers a heartwarming, retrospective experience full of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d memories. Beyond showcasing the cast\u2019s memorable moments, the ad pulled in fans and authentically celebrated their journey too.\nHBO Max used YouTube to power the campaign. As JP Mallo, VP of marketing for HBO Max Originals, explains, \u201cYouTube is often our initial indicator when we release early marketing assets for how our audience is engaging, what sentiments we\u2019re seeing, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re responding to in terms of content themes.\u201d\nYouTube proved to be an ideal home for HBO Max\u2019s ads, since people of all ages gravitate to the platform for nostalgic content. According to a 2022 Ipsos survey, 80% of Gen Z reported watching YouTube to feel nostalgic;1 by running a nostalgia-based campaign on YouTube, HBO Max could appeal to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d enthusiasts, while also grabbing the attention of a younger generation.\nThe campaign launched mid-November with bumper ads, plus non-skippable and skippable in-stream ads to drive awareness and consideration. Then, in the days leading up to the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, HBO Max used YouTube Select to feature the ads alongside premium content. Finally, they concluded the campaign by leveraging YouTube Masthead before and after the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, placing the video on YouTube\u2019s home feed to drive mass awareness. In the end, the approach drove 12.7% awareness lift \u2014 remarkable for a brand with high awareness already \u2014 and reached 49 million unique users.\nWE, Egypt\u2019s primary telecommunications company, needed an ad campaign that could cut through the holiday noise during the busy Ramadan season. To achieve this, it strategized videos that would help viewers understand evolving trends of Ramadan.\nSince WE\u2019s message had to appeal to viewers across multiple generations, the team determined that \u201cthe campaign should include a diverse mix of ads,\u201d says Eslam Nassar, the brand\u2019s head of digital marketing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we turned to YouTube to tell a compelling, creative story across ad formats and screens.\u201d\nWE planned and executed a full-funnel video strategy that leveraged a unique blend of short- and long-form ads. For viewers in the awareness phase, the team launched 6-second bumper ads to tease the campaign and deliver a quick call to action.\nThen, to further engage middle- and lower-funnel audiences, WE created a full-length, in-stream video. This ad was designed to be watched across devices, from connected TV to mobile. To ensure that this long-form ad could fully immerse people in the brand\u2019s unique approach to storytelling, the team relied on YouTube\u2019s four guiding principles for effective video ads on the platform, the ABCDs \u2014 shorthand for attention, branding, connection and direction.\nTo quickly gain the attention of and connect with viewers, the video began with a catchy musical track. WE made sure the distinctive purple color of its logo dominated the video\u2019s visuals to reinforce company branding. To further connect with multigenerational viewers, the video compared and contrasted Ramadan traditions throughout the ages. Finally, the video directed people to take action by signing up for WE\u2019s services so they could stay in touch with family.\nThis multiformat strategy proved successful. Within the first 24 hours, the long-form video exceeded 1 million views. What\u2019s more, its completion rate surpassed the brand\u2019s 2021 Ramadan video by 204% as well as the market average for completion rate by 47%. Ultimately, the campaign reached 79% of Egypt\u2019s YouTube population.\nWE\u2019s digital advertising manager, Ahmed Nageb, concludes, \u201cYouTube is one of most important platforms to help us execute our digital strategies effectively. Because of its vast audience, which can be targeted through various ad formats and devices, we were able to achieve maximum reach, while hitting our campaign objectives.\u201d\nLast year, BMW launched its first ever fully electric BMW iX sports activity vehicle in the United States. To promote this milestone during the Super Bowl, BMW created a 60-second hero video ad that showed Zeus, the mythical Greek god of sky and thunder, retiring to Palm Springs and rediscovering his spark when gifted a BMW iX by his wife, Hera.\nTo extend the ad\u2019s reach during this tentpole moment, BMW made YouTube a core part of its Super Bowl strategy. \u201cYouTube is a great amplifier of content, which not only increased the audience size exponentially but extended the longevity of the spot,\u201d explains Albrecht Pagenstert, head of brand marketing at BMW. \u201cWhat ran once during the Super Bowl lives online and has received millions of additional views.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s strategy hinged on reaching a wide variety of passionate Super Bowl fans through YouTube AdBlitz, the premier hub for fans to watch Super Bowl ads with playlists for the most comedic, dramatic, action-packed, and inspirational spots. Through AdBlitz, BMW could target specific Super Bowl-related video inventory, such as NFL Highlights watched by sports lovers, and Big Game Music Lineups watched by audiophiles.\nOnce the campaign peaked viewers\u2019 interest during YouTube AdBlitz, BMW then strategized to satisfy their hunger for more content. It released behind-the-scenes videos, including interviews with the hero ad\u2019s star-studded cast and director.\nAudiences couldn\u2019t get enough of BMW\u2019s campaign. In fact, many YouTube commenters enthusiastically asked for the hero video to be turned into a full movie. In the end, the video drove 17 million unique views and 970,000 clicks. In addition to being recognized on YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard in the U.S., BMW earned the No. 7 spot in USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter.\nHBO Max, WE, and BMW struck gold with video ads that entertained and engaged key audiences. By aligning their ads with popular YouTube trends, building bespoke creative for different platforms, and following the ABCDs of video effectiveness, these brands showed how to successfully combine immersive storytelling with the power of YouTube."

        "input": "",
        "output": "It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in the middle of a digital video boom, as alternatives to linear TV grow at unprecedented rates. According to Nielsen\u2019s total TV and streaming report, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time.1 And viewers watch a daily average of over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV devices.2\nSource: YouTube Internal Data, Global, Jan. 2022.\nThis level of engagement informs how viewers feel about ads. In a new study, we found that viewers agree that YouTube ads on the TV screen are more relevant (59%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3 Connected TV gives advertisers a powerful creative canvas to reach viewers when they are highly engaged, streaming their favorite content on the living room screen.\nTo better understand the opportunity for advertisers, these three brands ran experiments to see how effective CTV could be for their audiences. Here are the questions they set out to answer.\nOn behalf of its Ruffles brand, Frito-Lay North America leveraged CTV to engage with some of its core audiences, such as younger families, flavor variety seekers, millennials, and those living in urban areas. The marketing team wanted to understand how increases in watch time on CTV contributed to brand and sales goals.\nIn 2021, Ruffles ran an A/B test with half the media budget delivered across devices as usual and the other half with an increased allocation to CTV. It then compared performance to delivery.\nThe result? \u201cThe higher delivery to the increased CTV cells exceeded our expectations and benchmarks across view rates, ad recall, and sales lift,\u201d said Amanda Corral, senior director of paid media strategy at Frito-Lay North America. \u201cAnd we achieved this without sacrificing CPM or reach. We were thrilled to deliver a strong impact while maintaining efficiency and delivering higher ROI.\u201d\nL\u2019Oreal USA has built its brands with a commitment to consumer-centricity. Across its brands, that has meant committing to cut-through creative. (Think, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re born with it, maybe it\u2019s \u2026 .\u201d You know the rest.) It has also meant constantly refining media and audience strategies that evolve as the brands\u2019 customers do. For the past several years, L\u2019Oreal USA has followed the lead of its customers and ramped up investment in YouTube.\nThe company has honed a tried-and-true approach to creative and reach, and wanted to see how that approach scaled to CTV. So in the summer of 2021, when it was time to lean into upper-format, demand-generating media, L\u2019Oreal USA increased its YouTube investment by 102% year over year. \u201cWhat was interesting about this time was, we were seeing audience behavior patterns around ad-supported streaming and a boom in CTV that we knew wasn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d said Shenan Reed, SVP, head of media at L\u2019Oreal USA.\nThe company ran a meta-analysis across nearly 30 NCS sales lift studies and found that its YouTube activity delivered an average of 6% sales lift for its campaigns. The company also saw a 6 to 1 return on ad spend on YouTube CTV screens. Not only did this prove that L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s creative and audience strategies can scale to CTV, but it also saw that the majority of impact was coming from new consumers. That\u2019s important because, coming out of the pandemic, the team knew the company needed to attract the next generation of new consumers and first-time buyers.\n\u201cOur consumer is still in the living room, but they\u2019re watching a wider variety of content \u2014 content that is more personal, that\u2019s more of the moment. You can ignore that behavior, or you can choose to show up. And we chose to show up,\u201d said Reed.\nDocuSign was initially apprehensive about CTV, since users aren\u2019t able to click through and convert on the TV screen. However, the brand put aside those reservations and decided to experiment by using the channel to increase reach and brand awareness. DocuSign understood the importance of reaching its users wherever they were, including their connected TVs.\n\u201cBefore this test, we didn\u2019t know there was such a large audience on CTV that we weren\u2019t reaching through other video ads,\u201d said Andy Tack, senior marketing manager at DocuSign.\nBy running a CTV-dedicated advertising campaign alongside a regular cross-device campaign, DocuSign was able to isolate and quantify the impact CTV had on its campaigns. The marketing team found that the CTV ads drove a best-in-class 33% relative lift in ad recall. Furthermore, despite worries about barriers to action, DocuSign actually saw a 126% relative conversion lift for its trial sign-ups.\n\u201cWe can now clearly see the value CTV has in our campaigns,\u201d said Tack. \u201cWhether we\u2019re growing brand awareness and recall, or improving consideration and purchase intent, CTV is a critical part of our approach.\u201d\nNo model exists for the perfect CTV advertising strategy. Whether planning media on behalf of a CPG company, reaching new cosmetics buyers, or taking a chance on a new channel, brands of all types are showing what can be done. The one thing they have in common is that their efforts were rewarded."

        "output": "In today\u2019s uncertain economy, video marketers may find it difficult to keep calm and carry on. For most, measuring the effectiveness of their media investments will be a top priority. And while focusing on measurement can help marketers fuel both short-term and long-term growth, not all measurement approaches are created equal. Success depends on having the right media strategies and tools.\nIt may be tempting, for instance, to concentrate only on immediate results during disruptive times. But savvy marketers will combine their short-term and long-term business goals and take a more holistic full-funnel approach to YouTube. Indeed, recent research by Nielsen shows that brands that added upper-funnel marketing efforts to existing mid-funnel campaigns were able to boost return on investment (ROI) by 70%. And brands that added upper-funnel tactics to campaigns that covered the middle and lower funnels were able to raise ROI by 13%.\nProving the value of a full-funnel video strategy requires using measurement tools and tactics that leverage how upper-funnel brand goals and lower-funnel performance objectives play off each other. To do this successfully, marketers can use an effective three-part framework that balances tried-and-new methods with newly emerging measurement practices. Two parts of the framework \u2014 attribution and incrementality \u2014 help set you up for short-term business outcomes, while the third part \u2014 marketing mix modeling \u2014 can help you make smarter decisions for the long haul.\nHere is a deeper look at how to apply the framework.\nThese days, using an attribution model that assigns credit for conversions to different ads that occur across the customer journey should be standard practice. When it\u2019s done right, attribution can help marketers easily optimize their ad strategies. Google\u2019s data-driven attribution model can help you analyze your customers\u2019 journey across Search, YouTube, and Display to discover which touchpoints are most effective.\nWhile attribution can help you uncover and optimize for opportunities quickly, it\u2019s important not to treat it as a stand-alone measurement solution. Relying only on attribution insights to optimize your plans may provide quick growth, but it will come at the risk of not investing in the upper-funnel branding strategies that constantly refuel the pool of customer demand. Additionally, as measurement becomes more challenging in a privacy-first world, having multiple sources of truth instead of relying solely on attribution will be critical. To take attribution to the next level, pair it with incrementality.\nOne powerful way to supplement attribution and take your measurement mix to the next level is to include incrementality. Generally defined as a lift or increase in a desired outcome, incrementality helps you understand the KPI uplift due to your ad. As a result, incrementality can help you better understand the impact of full-funnel campaigns and pave the way for longer term growth.\nThe primary way to measure incrementality is to measure the performance of your full-funnel video strategy using various lift metrics. Google offers an array of solutions to measure lift across the customer journey, including Brand Lift , Search Lift, and Conversion Lift. When combined into one unified view of measurement, Google uses these metrics to showcase the value and impact of YouTube full-funnel campaigns that span all marketing objectives to help you understand the effectiveness of each.\nIncrementality should never be treated as a one-off exercise, regardless of the outcome. Embracing a test-and-learn mindset will better position brands for resilience and long-term growth. Harvard Business Review found that marketers who run multiple tests see up to 30% higher ad performance. Once you have results in hand, optimize your media accordingly. Keep in mind that it\u2019s critical to continue gathering insights and refining your strategy beyond your initial tests. Building experimentation into your overall measurement plan will help ensure that you are consistently optimizing and refining over time.\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is a tried-and-true, privacy-durable way to measure the impact of all YouTube formats across the funnel. It is also an effective way to capture both the short- and long-term impact of marketing investments. Using longitudinal online and offline data, MMMs provide you with the ROI for each media channel. Not only should these studies be used to show how media channels performed in the past, they should be used to optimize your media allocations moving forward.\nResults from MMM studies take into account a combination of variables, so it\u2019s critical to break out YouTube from other video platforms where possible. A Nielsen study found that the return on ad spend from marketing mix models varied by as much as 48% when video platforms were individualized versus when they were aggregated together. And format-level insights provide the most actionable level of granularity, especially when it comes to a full-funnel mix. Inputs matter when it comes to your model.\nEconomic uncertainty can rattle even the most confident marketer. But adopting a full-funnel video media strategy and balancing complementary short-term and long-term measurement practices can help fuel long-term business growth. To ensure the value and effectiveness of your full-funnel strategy, marketers should leverage attribution, incrementality, continuous experimentation, and MMM to drive short-term performance and reach your overarching branding goals."

        "output": "Marie Gulin-Merle, global VP of ads marketing at Google, speaks at a round-table discussion about the AI revolution during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about a meeting I had more than a decade ago, when digital marketing was at the beginning of its mobile revolution. A consulting company was advising me to embrace \u201creal-time\u201d marketing. I was intrigued, but didn\u2019t think it was attainable given the state of the technology we had at that time.\nI was spending my days in the trenches with my teams and agencies. We wrestled with how to create assets across an ever-multiplying set of formats. We scrambled to keep up with trends that would ignite like wildfire, only to dissipate just as quickly. We were manually piecing together the right media mix and trying to figure out how to spend budgets in a way that delivered ROI.\nMore than anything, I dreamed of being able to get out of the weeds of digital execution to focus my attention on our customer connections, the quality of our storytelling, and our business outcomes. I just wanted to get back to marketing. But, at the time, that felt like science fiction.\nNot anymore.\nWe\u2019re all already using AI to reach our customers more efficiently. In fact, 80% of Google\u2019s customers are already using AI-powered Search ads products. Now with generative AI, marketers have a rapidly expanding set of AI-powered tools with the potential to revolutionize every single part of marketing \u2014 from how we mine for insights, brainstorm ideas, and generate content to how we connect with people, drive growth, and measure performance.\nWhen it comes to content, my biggest pain point as a marketer is simple. There are never enough people to keep up with the velocity, volume, and variations required to reach people when and where I need to.\nNow, with new AI-powered tools, my team can scale the creative concepts we love to more formats with unprecedented precision. This means more time and attention can be devoted to shaping core creative concepts. AI can then draw from this source material to instantaneously generate assets like social copy, landing pages, and emails.\nAI can do the same for ads, with alternate ad copy, automatically formatted videos, and multiple combinations of product photos, all leading to infinite permutations of tailored ads for every customer.\nAt Google we\u2019ve been using AI in our ad products since 2015. And we\u2019re already allocating a significant amount of our media spend toward AI-generated creative across Display, Video, and Search, because it has proved to be effective. There are three core areas we\u2019re focused on.\nCreative testing: Google Cloud technology is helping us use AI to score creative, predicting success or failure, before we put it out into the world. In ongoing pilots, we\u2019re using AI to help us weed out poor performers more quickly and to more easily identify potential winners. We\u2019re also working with an agency partner to apply AI to our creative asset library. That way we can understand what has performed well historically and use that knowledge to develop future campaigns.\nCampaign optimization: Our marketing teams do all of their on-stack optimization with AI. Our teams are using AI to identify the best mix of formats and placements to meet our goals across screens and audiences. Although people\u2019s behaviors are complex, reaching them across multiple surfaces \u2014 YouTube, Search, Gmail, Maps, Shopping, and Discover \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be. For example, Performance Max, our AI-powered campaign type, is driving an 18% uplift in conversions at a similar cost per action.1\nMeasurement: In response to people\u2019s increasing expectations for digital privacy, regulators and tech platforms are restricting techniques that advertisers have relied on for decades to reach audiences and measure results, such as device IDs and third-party cookies. We\u2019ve all long relied on huge stores of data to drive performance and measurement. AI is helping us use fewer signals, while driving the intelligence and trusted measurement we need.\nStill, it will take more than a culture of experimentation to capture AI\u2019s full potential. We are making sure we learn and then scale. Only then can we develop a deeper understanding of how and when AI can be deployed to augment and amplify human skills. To make this all as easy as possible to navigate, my team put together a list of AI Essentials that you can use to make sure you have the right AI foundation.\nAs we embark on this journey, what gives us confidence is Google\u2019s bold and responsible approach. AI has incredible potential to benefit our industry, but it is not without risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be responsible from the start. As an example, to address misinformation, Google will soon be integrating new innovations like \u201cabout this image\u201d metadata in Search and image watermarking. We are also using AI to deliver a privacy-first ads experience that drives results for performance marketers while also protecting consumers\u2019 privacy.\nIt\u2019s such an exciting time. The tools and capabilities I could only dream about in my days as a CMO in consumer packaged goods and retail are here \u2014 now. Marketing is about connecting brands and products to people. The \u201cwhat\u201d remains the same. The \u201chow\u201d is changing again. Marketers, we can finally get back to marketing.\nOur marketing teams here at Google have been experimenting with AI tools to be more productive and creative. Take a look."

        "output": "Marketers are told time and again to factor return on investment (ROI) into their media planning decisions, but putting this into practice can be daunting. It doesn\u2019t help that the media landscape is more fragmented than ever, making it difficult to isolate the impact of any given ad placement, let alone optimize for it.\nAt Google, we work closely with clients to improve media measurement and have come to recognize marketing mix models (MMMs) as the most comprehensive way of understanding ROI measurement across different media channels, spanning online and offline.\nAnalyzing a range of advertiser MMM results over the years has also helped us identify the key contributors to ROI growth for YouTube in particular. Our research shows that there are four primary levers of video ROI: creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience.\nOf course, optimizing each of these levers can look quite different from one advertiser to the next. Every marketer should experiment to understand what works best. Doing so will help them confidently make decisions around their campaigns, resulting not only in better ads but better returns.\nTo understand how each of these work, let\u2019s walk through the stories of four brands that discovered firsthand how these levers increased their ROI.\nResearch has shown that effective creative accounts for almost 50% of ROI.1 Google analysts and researchers have studied thousands of ads to understand what specific elements drive performance on YouTube. We call these elements the ABCD principles: attention, branding, connection, and direction. According to research conducted by Nielsen, ads following the ABCD principles saw a 30% higher sales lift than ads that didn\u2019t adhere to them.2 Google sales teams are equipped to help brands analyze and optimize their creative for YouTube to drive greater business impact.\nShapermint, a global e-commerce brand, wanted to both boost its brand and drive product sales. Over the course of seven weeks, it ran experiments to understand what combination of creative drove the best results in its YouTube ad campaigns. By alternating among user testimonials, product demos, and a special offer, each video had its own unique angle. Shapermint tested the impact of its messaging along with other creative levers, such as length and pacing. As a result, the brand found its optimal combination of creative, assembling a powerful mix that lowered its cost per acquisition (CPA) by 21% and drove 50% more purchases.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start by building out the foundation of your video creative according to the ABCDs, and then try experimenting with various creative elements to see what works best for your audience.\nDifferent YouTube formats serve different objectives, but research shows that full-funnel strategies consistently deliver higher ROI. Brands that combine both awareness and action YouTube ad formats as part of a full-funnel strategy see higher ROI than when using either one in isolation. Based on a custom Nielsen meta-analysis, a full-funnel YouTube strategy drives 10% higher ROI compared to awareness advertising alone.3\nSulwhasoo is a South Korean luxury skin care brand from Amorepacific. Having surpassed $790 million (1 trillion KRW) in annual sales, it is quite well known. However, it wanted to try leveraging YouTube ads to drive more conversions beyond the awareness campaigns it had historically relied on. For this experimental campaign, Sulwhasoo first used a foundation of awareness and consideration formats to maximize its audience reach. Then it layered in action formats for the first time, turning attention into action. With this YouTube full-funnel strategy, the brand saw a staggering 91% decrease in CPA and a 13.8X increase in conversion rate.\nWhile it might seem intuitive to primarily buy action formats in the pursuit of tangible ROI, advertisers will see higher returns by adding awareness formats. In fact, a recent study shows that YouTube advertisers see Awareness formats driving 28% of their conversion assists.4\nThough reach and frequency are closely knit, each impacts ROI quite differently. All else being equal, increasing reach usually maintains ROI, while increasing frequency past a specific point usually diminishes ad effectiveness. For many advertisers, this well-known rule of thumb can make them fearful of increasing their frequencies. However, most advertisers overindex on cautiousness, and, in reality, have more breathing room to increase frequency on YouTube than they might think. On average, brands can increase average weekly frequency on YouTube from one to three ad exposures without diminishing YouTube ad effectiveness, according to an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen.5\nTo simplify the process, we\u2019ve recently started letting advertisers using Video reach campaigns choose a frequency target of up to five impressions per week, helping them to achieve maximum reach while setting a desired weekly frequency. This leads to a more efficient spend and a better experience for viewers. And we\u2019re piloting YouTube reach and frequency data availability through our MMM data platform to help advertisers understand their measurements better.\nFor example, after including reach and frequency data in its commercial mix modeling program with Analytic Partners, Peloton discovered that its ideal optimization strategy was more nuanced than it had expected. The results showed that there was an opportunity to drive incremental reach after optimizing frequency, leading to a potential ROI improvement of 15%.\nLast but not least, who you show your ads to significantly affects your ROI. Every brand has at least one demographic audience, but adding in audiences based on interests and behaviors can help you reach more potential customers. For example, a beauty brand might want to show its ads to viewers who are watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or a pet food company could choose to show its ads to those who recently searched for \u201cbest organic dog foods.\u201d These nuances can make all the difference in final purchase decisions.\nThe Insights Finder tool helps marketers uncover actionable audience insights related to interests, demographics, and more, using aggregated and anonymized signals from Google and YouTube. These insights allow brands to add new audience segments and to see how their ROI is affected. Oreo used Insights Finder to break down their audience into four segments: Entertainment Fans, Trendsetters, Gamers, and Foodies. The brand created personalized creative for each of these segments and saw an impressive 100% year-over-year improvement in YouTube ROI.\nBy focusing on creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience, advertisers can better understand the contributors to their ROI. Google teams can help brands that are on this journey figure out how to optimize each of these four levers. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen, YouTube return on ad spend grew by 108%, on average, for brands after collaborating with Google, an increase that was 7X greater than seen by brands that did not collaborate with Google.6 Close partnership with our media customers is absolutely key to capturing the power of media mix modeling."

        "input": "",
        "output": "From brushing our teeth in the morning to cleaning the kitchen counter after dinner, home and personal care (HPC) products are an essential part of our daily routines. Because these items are ubiquitous, finding imaginative ways to market them can sometimes be a challenge.\nWe know, however, that when it comes to designing ads to break through the clutter, creative has proved to be a particularly powerful tool for advertisers. Our team analyzed thousands of global HPC ads to understand exactly what kind of creative choices make some of these ads more effective than others. What we found pointed us to five creative insights about what resonates with viewers when it comes to HPC ads.\nResearch and development is how brands differentiate themselves. And while R&D is critically important, how brands communicate those differentiators is just as significant. Rather than using complex terminology (whether it\u2019s a little known ingredient or a reference to a scientific process), help people by simplifying the language or concept into a language they can easily understand.\nFor example, instead of describing technicalities, Liquid Plumr shows its benefits through a straightforward test: a universally relatable experience of a sink clogged by the oatmeal and cucumber chunks from a home-spa mask. The ad lets the viewer see the product\u2019s capabilities rather than explaining it, as one pour of Liquid Plumr clears away the clog in a single satisfying visual.\nRather than trying to hit the entire marketing funnel with a single ad, consider the creative choices that accurately address a specific objective. What works to effectively drive short-term sales goals looks quite different from ads that are focused on long-term brand equity. Ads focused on brand building can often benefit from a longer, more creative story, whereas ads focused on short-term sales and performance work the hardest when the focus is on the product itself.1\nWith the release of their new vacuum cleaner model, Bosch Hausger\u00e4te (Domestic Appliances) created a 20-second spot showing the product in action and focusing on one key feature, an approach that proved to be effective in driving short-term sales. However, when it came to creating their brand campaign, Bosch took a very different creative path. The minute-long spot featured a cast of several characters, each with distinct storylines tied together by the campaign slogan #LikeABosch, showing all the ways Bosch can play a role in our everyday lives.\nPersonal care products are just that: personal. People want to see that the product can fit into their everyday lifestyle, and being seen in that process is important. To reach all of your consumers, consider who you\u2019re portraying in your campaigns. More inclusive representation across ethnicities, ages, and genders can drive greater engagement and help your consumers connect with your brand proposition. In fact, representation is the No. 1 driver for ad recall for HPC ads, proving that integrating diversity into your ads can leave a lasting impression.2\nAll Good, a diaper brand focused on sustainability and clean ingredients, made sure to speak to all parents with its campaign. Recognizing that all kinds of families exist \u2014 whether interracial, young, single-parent \u2014 it acknowledges that many parenting struggles are universal no matter who you are. This allows viewers to connect with the brand in a more authentic, genuine way, simply by being seen and heard.\nPeople don\u2019t always have a strong emotional connection to products, especially when it comes to everyday things in home and personal care. Building that connection is vital to engagement and can help a brand stand out. Having a creative, evocative storyline that goes beyond the product can go a long way in capturing a viewer\u2019s attention.\nVeet France\u2019s \u201cYour hair, your choice, our products\u201d campaign walks through a number of poignant vignettes of various women: with a lover in bed, at a lively summertime party, laying in the grass, and admiring their arm hair. By showing a range of body types and body hair, it tells a story of the many different ways one can be a woman. A single overlying narration directly addressing the audience helps send a message about everyone being entitled to their own opinions on their bodies and body hair. Though its products are touted as a way of helping people do whatever they want with their hair, the story goes far beyond the product line.\nPeople usually don\u2019t think about what personal care products sound like, but the use of audio can evoke memories, help us more easily contextualize something, or amplify messaging. Audio is an underutilized resource in video ads despite it being one of the most effective ways to drive lift across brand metrics. Use it to amplify any visual element, like brand names or supers. Audio can also be used for product usage cues, like the spray of a bottle or the splash of a product pour.\nDowny Korea promoted its Puff laundry detergent with a short but evocative spot. When the character squeezes the puff, a sound effect emphasizes the satisfying, squishy texture, allowing the viewer to imagine what it feels like without being able to touch the product. Then, as the puff hits the laundry water, it bursts with an explosive sound. The dramatic, powerful sound communicates how vigorous its cleaning capabilities are.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why these five data-backed tactics can benefit the creative for your next HPC ad. They\u2019ll serve as a starting point for building a strong foundation as you apply your own creative angles that are true to your brand. And to really maximize your ads\u2019 effectiveness, remember to continually experiment with your creative to understand what truly drives the best results for your brand and audience."

        "output": "At YouTube, we\u2019ve analyzed the content and creators that broke through in 2022 to uncover the global insights and themes we believe will help define consumer trends in 2023. Based on what we found, we\u2019ve identified three ways marketers can take inspiration from successful creators to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with their audiences.\nThe most successful marketing shows an understanding of what motivates an audience to engage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to value online communities and understand how they can amplify and strengthen your messages.\nCreators excel at this. The top YouTube content of 2022 demonstrates how creators can inspire active engagement from their communities through moments that capture public attention. In the U.K., for example, British YouTubers Sidemen brought together audiences from many top creators to raise over $1 million during their charity football match. Meanwhile, in the U.S., American creator MrBeast made YouTube\u2019s 2022 year-end list for top 10 creators with a Willy Wonka-themed challenge video, featuring contestants from his fan base. And in Germany, the continued success of collaboration duo 7 vs. Wild can be partly attributed to their viewers, who share their takes in scores of reaction videos.\nAcross moments and geographies, viewers are forging connections with communities online that they may not interact with elsewhere. Indeed, 55% of Gen Z agree that they watch content that no one they know personally is interested in.1\nThe takeaway for marketers? Find ways to encourage participation from online groups who have specific personal interests and lean into them. By doing so, you can create brand moments with greater impact and meaning.\nIn 2022, audience interest spanned multiple formats and content categories, and their preferences often changed based on their mindset and the moment. While this trend may seem like an obstacle, it presents a great opportunity for marketers to follow the lead of creators who successfully reach new audiences by meeting them where they are.\nIn the past year, creators who told stories across multiple formats had the fastest growing audiences. For instance, Indonesian swimmer Timotius Mulyadi, whose long-form videos usually clock in at over eight minutes long, experimented with 60-second swimming tutorials, which made him one of his country\u2019s breakout creators last year.\nFact is, engaging audiences successfully in one format often means that viewers will follow you from screen to screen. Our research shows that 59% of Gen Z agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nShakira successfully capitalized on this behavior when she promoted the release of her latest song with Rauw Alejandro, \u201cTe Felecito.\u201d Instead of simply launching the music video, she used a series of Shorts to excite fans and encourage them to watch the full video experience. First, she sparked curiosity by inserting teasers from her new video into the YouTube thumbnails of her all-time classic videos. Then she released a preview of her new video on YouTube Shorts. Finally, she launched a group of Shorts that taught viewers how to do the video\u2019s choreography, which sparked a new dance challenge. This creative use of multiformat content helped her music video become the sixth most-watched in Mexico in 2022 according to YouTube Music trends.\nMeeting your audience where they are also means speaking their language, sometimes quite literally. MrBeast showed up on top creator lists in Brazil and France by using dubbed language channels. Meanwhile, Brazilian creator Jooj Natu\u2019s English-language channel helped him extend his reach into the U.S. and Canada.\nWhile marketers can take inspiration from the multiformat success of these creators, they can also engage with new audiences in a very simple and attainable way. According to a Google study, adding a vertical creative asset to a Video action campaign delivered 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts than using landscape assets alone.3\nIn the past, viral short-form videos often resulted from accidental, random moments captured on camera. But these days, Shorts are less off-the-cuff, and more crafted and intentional.\nThe Shorts that attract the largest audiences have been specifically designed to recreate the spontaneous feel of those older videos, with deliberate moments of surprise and delight. For creative inspiration, marketers can look to circus acrobat Jake Hinga, who found Shorts success by capturing him and his friends undertaking elaborate trampoline challenges. Alternatively, they can see how Chris Ivan, the king of toilet plunger trick shots, reached 80 million views by collaborating with restaurant business, Dave & Busters.\nBut Shorts don\u2019t need to seem spontaneous to be successful. Last year, comedy creators attracted audiences with character-driven sketches and parodies. Take Germany\u2019s Anna Strigl, who encouraged environmental activism in one of the country\u2019s most viewed Shorts of the year.\nThe most important takeaway for marketers is that the best short-form videos embrace the format\u2019s strength and encourage people to watch them again and again. What does this mean exactly? According to our list of top creator tips, one major thing marketers need to do is give their Shorts an immediate hook. As The Korean Vegan, a U.S.-based cooking creator, says, \u201cThe first one to two seconds are the most important. That hook better be visually, audibly, and intellectually irresistible.\u201d\nLeveraging communities, meeting audiences where they are, and creating innovative Shorts aren\u2019t just YouTube strategies. Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the way audience expectations are evolving. Marketers who incorporate these actions into their creative will empower themselves to successfully connect with the right audiences at the right moments in 2023 and beyond."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you\u2019ve watched YouTube throughout the years, you know it\u2019s evolved quite a bit. Long gone are the days when the content exclusively centered on off-the-cuff vlogs. Now, YouTube is a place that millions go to witness major cultural events. But even beyond that, people are turning to YouTube to experience the moments around these moments.\nTake me, for example. I recently watched Silk Sonic\u2019s 64th Grammy Awards performance on YouTube. Then I found myself watching video after video of related content, like Kyle Hanagami\u2019s choreography to a Silk Sonic song. I went from enjoying one performance at a major event to digging deeper into the culture surrounding that performance.\nThis type of watch behavior is ubiquitous on YouTube, and it gives brands the unique opportunity to make advertising budgets go further and work harder. Recent campaigns from Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z International are proof of this. Here\u2019s how each company successfully used YouTube to stand out, extend its reach, and increase brand awareness during a key tentpole moment.\nLast year, Hyundai planned to debut its new electric vehicle (EV), the Ioniq 5, during the Super Bowl. Angela Zepeda, Hyundai\u2019s CMO, says, \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center.\u201d\nWith more people watching live sports online, Hyundai wisely opted for a multimedia campaign. It aired a TV spot during both the NFL\u2019s AFC and NFC Championship games and again during the Super Bowl pregame show. However, in contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai went digital-first during the Super Bowl.\nAs Zepeda explains, \u201cWe know that digital-first audiences care deeply about keeping their pulse on the cultural zeitgeist, but are less likely to have standard cable and more likely to be cord-cutters. That\u2019s where YouTube came in.\u201d After consulting a Nielsen study showing YouTube as the leader in streaming watch time in the U.S., Hyundai felt confident that the platform would put them front and center with its audience.\nCore to Hyundai\u2019s digital-first approach was investing in YouTube AdBlitz inventory and surrounding its ads with Super Bowl-related content. This included videos directly related to the big game, such as NFL highlight footage, along with content tangentially related to the Super Bowl, like recipes and cooking demonstrations geared toward foodies and tailgaters. By doing so, Hyundai extended its reach beyond the mainstream Super Bowl culture and tapped into the event\u2019s subcultures.\nTiming was also integral to Hyundai\u2019s approach. The company extended its campaign to run for a full month, which allowed it to become part of the Super Bowl hype in the weeks leading up to and following the game.\nThis video content strategy paid off. After the campaign generated more than 247 million impressions, Hyundai became a big brand winner of the AdBlitz 2022 contest, an honor given to brands who receive the most views on their Super Bowl commercial. Additionally, by starting its campaign early during off-peak days, the brand also reduced its cost per unique view by 50% compared to a traditional Super Bowl buy.\nFor Pride Month this year, bubly partnered with the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, and the chosen families and safe places that allow its members to flourish. As part of the partnership, the brand created a short film called Coming Home, which offered a simple, yet powerful message: Everyone deserves a family.\nTo promote the film and ensure it got the viewership and engagement it deserved, bubly knew it was important to find the right platform. As Conor Dwyer, brand communications lead at PepsiCo, explains, \u201cYouTube was among the only platforms where we could functionally and efficiently deliver a video ad that surpassed two minutes and reach an audience already primed for viewing long-form content.\u201d YouTube also helped bubly\u2019s film reach a wider range of relevant audiences through behavioral and contextual targeting, including affinity segments like LGBTQ Content Enthusiasts, and ensure it appeared alongside relevant content.\nWith the power of YouTube behind it, the film earned more than 6 million views and a view rate above 50%. The film also drove heightened interest in the brand, which saw a 1091% relative lift in searches for \u201cbubly.\u201d\nMondel\u0113z decided to promote its Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand during Italy\u2019s biggest national music festival and song contest, the Sanremo Music Festival. This involved sponsoring the YouTube channels for the artists in the festival and running a YouTube homepage masthead during the weeklong event. The brand chose YouTube because it knew the platform would be ideal for immersing in the excitement of the festival and reaching as many music fans as possible. It was a smart strategy, as music streaming had been growing in popularity since the start of the pandemic, especially on YouTube.\nTo reach the largest online audience possible, Mondel\u0113z ran a 25% share of voice YouTube campaign, which guarantees advertisers a set percentage of ads around certain content groups. For Mondel\u0113z, that meant its campaign could run on the official YouTube channels of all the top artists competing in the Sanremo festival. Mondel\u0113z not only extended its campaign reach by leaning into the momentum from the main event, but also by tapping into the excitement before, during, and after the festival.\nMondel\u0113z also secured a YouTube masthead ad exclusively on connected TV. This helped the brand reach a new, fast-growing base of connected TV viewers and keep the Philadelphia brand front and center over the course of the festival.\nIn the end, Mondel\u0113z\u2019 connected TV masthead increased its reach by 30%, and the overall campaign successfully reached 5.4 million unique users, garnering almost 20 million impressions in just 14 days.\nAs video viewers increasingly gravitate online, innovative companies like Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z show that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply run ads during tentpole moments. Instead, these companies found wider audiences and increased brand awareness by leveraging YouTube to tap into the subculture and tangential moments around the Super Bowl, Pride Month, and Sanremo Music Festival. Their strategies and resulting success can inspire brands of all sizes to find greater reach and new fans on YouTube."

        "output": "The demand for advertising to drive results is higher than ever, and as a result, creative must perform like never before.\nThe ICONIC \u2014 Australia's leading online fashion retailer \u2014 was looking to grow its sportswear sales, and in the process, reaped the benefits of building bespoke creative for YouTube. Four unique films were made using Video Action, showing athletes performing a sport under extreme pressure, practically begging viewers to hit the blue button to allow them to stop. Viewer action was enabled by showing a product feed featuring the products the athletes were wearing in each ad, allowing viewers to shop the outfit.\nBuilt in collaboration with Google\u2019s Creative Works team and production company The Glue Society, the work highlights three tactics to help demand attention, and drive clicks.\nVideo Action is unskippable for the first five seconds, so the \u201caudition\u201d time is pivotal. While there are a range of ways creatives have tackled this, The ICONIC simultaneously feature the brand message and hook the viewer in early \u2014 ensuring that if they don\u2019t take immediate action, they\u2019ll engage long enough to be convinced to click.\nLeveraging Video Action, The ICONIC asked only one thing from viewers. Hit the blue button. By taking advantage of interactivity, and deeply embedding it within the creative idea with actors playing out scenarios, The ICONIC ensures it's doing something with the attention they\u2019ve just won. By creating bespoke videos, the campaign delivered an 87% higher CTR than the TrueView for Action benchmark*.* Source: Google Internal Data\nYouTube, and Video Action are sound-on mediums. So not only does the audition period consist of an engaging face-to-camera moment, the voices of the talent put out the plea for attention and make the creative feel personal \u2014 an integral part of establishing a connection with viewers fast.\nIn the increasingly competitive battle for audience attention, making the most of the medium is proving an effective way to win.\n\u201cIn taking advantage of the best-in-class practices for YouTube, and tailoring the creative idea to the format, The ICONIC has achieved a level of engagement that couldn\u2019t have otherwise been accomplished.\u201d says Victoria Berthinussen, Creative Development Lead at Google\u2019s Creative Works.\nGoogle's Creative Works team partners with some of the world\u2019s leading brands to understand what makes for effective creative.

        "output": "A few weeks ago, I experienced a quintessential New York moment. I was double parked on the busy street outside my New York City apartment, desperately trying to install a car seat I had recently purchased for my 3-year-old daughter. At any moment, I knew I could be honked at for blocking other cars.\nSo I quickly whipped out my phone and headed to the Car Seat Lady on YouTube, a channel I frequently consult when I\u2019m in the market to buy a new car seat and in stressful parenting moments like this. There, I knew I could find step-by-step instructions and incredibly accurate estimates of how long it would take someone like me to install a brand-new car seat in a high-pressure situation.\nMy experience isn\u2019t unique. People all over the world turn to YouTube for help with products they just bought. In fact, they\u2019re relying on YouTube for guidance and information during every part of their shopping journey, whether they\u2019re watching unboxing videos, getting product reviews, or learning from how-to videos. This is particularly true of Gen Z, who say that YouTube is more likely than other video and social media platform to meet their top shopping needs.1\nBut what exactly makes YouTube such a magnet for shoppers? And how can brands benefit from this close relationship between YouTube and its audience? To find out, we partnered with Talk Shoppe to conduct an extensive, qualitative research study and surveyed thousands of video users in the U.S. From our findings, we\u2019ve extracted three shopping insights that can help build brand loyalty and create repeat customers on YouTube.\nYes, discovering new and exciting brands online is important to shoppers. But what they value even more is finding reliable, trustworthy information that will help them buy a product with confidence. And, according to our research, viewers say YouTube ranks no. 1 against video services and social media platforms in key shopping needs, like finding honest information and feeling good about their purchases.2\nYouTube creators are a large part of the reason why people view the platform as a source of solid information, with 87% of viewers agreeing that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.3 As one of our survey participants said, \u201cYouTubers often give updates on how the product is doing three, six, or 12 months after purchasing, and they also will warn you about things to look out for.\u201d\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, 24 markets (AR, AU, BR, CL, CO, FR, DE, ID, IT, IN, JP, KR, MX, PE, PH, NZ, NL, ES, SE, TH, VN, AE, U.K., U.S.), n=48,000, 18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 20, 2021\u2013Feb. 19, 2022.\nTo explore this further, we spoke with creator-turned-entrepreneur Cassey Ho about how building trust with her YouTube followers contributed to the success of her direct-to-consumer brand, Popflex.\nFor over 13 years, Ho established herself as an authentic, trustworthy creator and CEO by sharing free workout videos on her Blogilates YouTube channel. \u201cFans would see me wearing my products or showcasing them in the background. They started asking me for a longer hoodie or a hoodie with a bigger hood to cover their long hair. What has really helped me build trust \u2026 is that I will take those comments as inspiration to develop my products. People felt heard.\u201d\nWhen we asked Gen Z what they prioritize when they shop using video or social platforms, they ranked finding a brand they love significantly higher than finding something trendy.4 This, of course, is great news for brands who hope to become a go-to destination for Gen Z and other shoppers. But exactly how do they become that universally loved brand? They can achieve this by creating a positive shopping experience that encourages people to buy from them again and again.\nThe key to a positive shopping experience is giving people product information they can trust, which will make them more satisfied with their final purchase. And our research showed that YouTube helps brands build this basis of trust. As one of our Gen Z survey participants stated, \u201cAfter buying something that I\u2019ve actually done research on [through] YouTube, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever returned anything.\u201d YouTube also helps brands win customers\u2019 loyalty, with 85% of people who use YouTube in their shopping journey saying they have purchased or planned to purchase a brand again.5\nSource: Google/TalkShoppe, U.S., Social Commerce and Video Shopping study, n=2,000 gen. pop. 18\u201364, Aug. 2022.\nWhile shoppers trust creators\u2019 recommendations and the information they find on YouTube, can the same be said about video ads? As part of our research, Talk Shoppe conducted a test to find out how people really feel about the ads they see. They created an ad for an imaginary coffee brand and showed survey participants how this ad might look on different online platforms. Participants were then asked to quickly associate the brand in the ad with certain words.\nThe test results showed that people trusted a brand much more when they saw it on a platform they trusted. More specifically, ads on YouTube were rated significantly more trustworthy, established, and credible than they were on every other platform.6 Thus, our research shows that brands can enjoy a halo effect \u2014 positive association \u2014 from the platforms or services they advertise on, which is vital information for brand marketers who want to get the most out of their media dollars.\nThese three shopper insights can help brands leverage the implicit trust people have in YouTube and its creators. By tapping into the satisfaction shoppers have when YouTube is part of their shopping journey and by benefiting from YouTube\u2019s halo effect, brands can turn one-time buyers into long-term loyal, repeat customers."

        "output": "If you ask a room full of advertisers, \u201cWhat makes a good video ad?\u201d you\u2019ll likely get a wide range of responses. But most will agree that good creative drives results. According to Nielsen, creative is responsible for almost half of a campaign\u2019s success.1 And when I recently ran a YouTube CMO roundtable, many clients spoke to creative customization and experimentation as key components of their success. Their experiences support the insight that relevance to viewers maximizes impact. Because different content resonates with different viewers, campaigns containing several versions of the same creative, each tailored to a specific audience, can be very effective.\nAdvancements in technology have led viewers to expect more relevance, thanks to a proliferation of choice. Now, ad creative must transform to meet those expectations. We developed Ads Creative Studio to streamline the production process by helping brands and agencies cut down on time and costs, and to facilitate collaboration between media and creative teams. Here\u2019s how two brands and an agency used the platform to create more effective ads.\nCustomization has always been a key part of PepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy, but their sparkling water brand bubly\u2019s impact on brand associations still had to be tested. The team wanted to find out how customized video ads for the brand might encourage their ideal audiences to associate it with house parties, barbecues, sports viewing, and other consumption moments. The goal? To deliver on a brief to better understand the consumer and eventually win them over.\nWith this experiment, PepsiCo wanted to gauge which of those occasion-specific messages, when aimed at relevant audiences, would resonate the most. With Ads Creative Studio, the process of building out a collection of customized assets became smoother and more efficient. The suite of tools allowed the teams to keep production internal by housing all design elements on a single platform.\n\u201cPrior to using Ads Creative Studio for video customization, we planned a high-level creative and targeting approach,\u201d said Terrence McLaughlin, associate marketing manager at PepsiCo. However, after using the tool to inventory creative variables to personalize, each with its own designated audience, they realized they had to adapt their creative process to be more tactical. \u201cAfter seeing the Ads Creative Studio user flow, we had to break down the elements of our proposed creative to mimic the framework in the platform.\u201d\nWith a single tool, the PepsiCo team was able to standardize processes across functions. As a result, the team found that campaigns with creative depicting social gathering and food pairing situations were most effective at driving brand lift. Equipped with that knowledge, teams can now craft bubly\u2019s stories around themes they know resonate with audiences they want to reach.\nWhen General Motors South America wanted to boost brand awareness of the Cruze 5 model, they decided to lean on customization beyond the basics. Drawing on Google insights, they created an audience strategy that relied on a collection of 14 different groups, including affinity audiences like \u201coutdoor enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cthrill seekers,\u201d and \u201cbeachbound travelers,\u201d as well as contextual audiences: those watching various types of auto-related content on YouTube. Each of these 14 groups would see an ad customized specifically to what would resonate with them.\nThe team was faced with the question of how to produce 14 unique ads, without sacrificing time, budget, or resources. They opted to try Ads Creative Studio.\n\u201cIt allows you to increase productivity and efficiency, both creatively and from media costs and metrics,\u201d said Gianluca Schinocca, media coordinator for GM Argentina. \u201cAmong the many benefits of Ads Creative Studio, production time saving and the large amount of videos produced are the ones that we found most impactful. We also reduced 30% in terms of costs, and, after the campaign, we noticed a huge increase in product searches.\u201d\nFor a true win, GM knew they would need measurable results in brand lift and search. In the end, with a 56% increase in Google searches for \u201cchevrolet cruze\u201d2 and a cost per view 32% less than the industry benchmark, the experiment was a success.\nFrom the agency perspective, Ads Creative Studio can eliminate the swirl that sometimes comes with ambitious undertakings. Creative agencies around the world are constantly dealing with gridlock in approvals and workflows. Men in Green, a Dutch creative agency, found that the suite of tools made it easier for designers to share and edit work. \u201cIt is the perfect solution for our challenge,\u201d said Jaap den Hertog, founder and CEO of Men in Green. \u201cIt gives a risk-free environment for designers to build [ad] creatives. It also allows for easy collaboration between multiple designers.\u201d\nPreviously, to maintain high production standards, Men in Green had strict quality controls in place that only allowed for senior designers to produce data-driven ad creatives within Display & Video 360. That meant junior designers could not create design variations, even when the team needed them. Because Ads Creative Studio is integrated into Display & Video 360, junior designers can now make their own ad creatives, halving the time it takes to deliver work and allowing senior designers to focus on quality assurance and publishing.\nTo their clients\u2019 delight, the data-driven ad creatives with tailored messaging decreased production costs significantly. When leading bath and body brand company Rituals was looking for a way to promote their Easter collection, Men in Green used templates to create personalized messages for each market. Not only did they save time and resources, but they also saw a 278% higher click-through rate, 64% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and 103% higher conversion rate compared to standard IAB banners.\nCreative is fundamental to campaign success. No matter what your goals are, a centralized suite of tools can be used to drive both efficiency and scale. By reducing barriers and enhancing efficiency, Ads Creative Studio makes it easier for teams to collaborate and create personalized assets quickly, at low cost. Coupled with video experimentation, these tools allowed three different organizations to determine the most effective story to engage each of their unique audiences."

        "output": "To explore the future impact of transformational changes in the creative realm, Google is partnering with Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 industry trailblazers on the Open Creative Project: an effort that brings together market analysis and insights from a series of in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders to encourage dialogue about the future of our industry. Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, shares early takeaways from the project.\nThe term \u201ccreative\u201d used to refer to a special class within the ad world: teams with a particular skill set who often sat apart, literally and figuratively, from the rest of their organizations. But when a pandemic forced all of us into digital spaces as safe havens to work and play, \u201ccreative\u201d took on a larger meaning.\nPeople who never went to design school or drafted a creative brief got more comfortable being their authentic selves online. Unknown chefs shared their passion for cooking on YouTube and discovered a global audience hungry for more. Gamers live streamed their adventures to thousands \u2014 sometimes millions \u2014 of rapt fans. In myriad new ways and spaces, everyday people started to share their stories, and some even partnered with brands to become powerful co-storytellers.\nMarketers and agencies, too, had to get more creative in solving clients\u2019 challenges, forging meaningful connections with consumers, and measuring success. And as marketers learned how to leverage new tools for creative automation, experimentation, assistance, and measurement, they grew more comfortable sharing ownership of a brand identity with the online communities organically remixing it. Together with those communities, they remade marketing and found fresh opportunities.\nAll of this adds up to more than just a \u201cthings are different now\u201d moment.\nFor us at Google, the combination of changes in consumer behavior, the rise of machine learning, the flourishing of user expression in unscripted spaces, and macroeconomic pressures felt like an inflection point for the industry, one where creative is poised to become the last unfair advantage.\nWith automation flattening media-driven returns, creative is becoming one of the most effective levers to drive differentiation and return on investment, and creative spend is increasing faster than media spend (6% versus 5% annually between 2018 and 2021).1 Knowing that these trends deserved a deep dive, we partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 including Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 creative industry trailblazers \u2014 on what we\u2019re calling the Open Creative Project.\nThrough intensive market analysis and in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders and trailblazers, we\u2019ve begun a thorough exploration of the why, the how, and the future impact of transformational changes already underway in the creative arena. And, over and over, we\u2019ve seen that concepts that once felt oppositional \u2014 art and science, unscripted expression and brand voice, advertising creators and users, brand and performance, imagination and automation \u2014 are increasingly interdependent.\nOur goal is to spark a new dialogue focused on the role creative will play in the broader advertising industry over the next three to five years. While this conversation will surely be shaped by the contributions and feedback of the entire advertising industry, we\u2019ve already keyed in on a few areas that present some of the biggest opportunities for marketers and brands.\nA natural place to start is with the rise of the creator economy, one of the strongest signals we have of where the future of creative \u2014 and all of marketing \u2014 is headed.\nThe explosion of truly unique and innovative content the ad industry has seen over the past three years is a direct product of a global cohort of diverse new voices adding their perspectives and contributions to the traditional marketing mix across old and new platforms. Case in point: Influencer marketing payments to creators for creative advertising services grew 50% annually between 2018 and 2021.2\nThe term \u201cowned media\u201d is now a relative one. Not only does every consumer have the tools to amplify, challenge, or riff on your brand\u2019s message through their personal channels and unscripted spaces, but so do thousands of influential creators with their own massive audiences and points of view.\nAnd experimentation, the willingness to try something new or different that\u2019s so key to creativity, is fast becoming a core competency \u2014 especially with the proliferation of tools that enable experimentation.\nThere are lessons here for organizations and brands ready to break creativity out of its silo. By being open to more active collaboration with creators around a shared point of view, brands can foster a more exciting and authentic conversation with their audiences. And there is value in thinking about the \u201ccreative team\u201d as everyone from CEO to the finance team.\nThere\u2019s no question that the relationships between digital platforms and the people who use them are being reshaped.\nBut amid the noise of an internet that offers everything, all the time, how can brands connect with the right people in a way that sticks? The answer lies in the new value exchange that\u2019s redefining how, when, and why brands earn people\u2019s attention, satisfaction, and trust. It\u2019s an exchange that only works reciprocally.\nIn other words, people already understand data\u2019s value for advertisers. When people appreciate the value and benefits they receive from the data they share, the more they trust a brand to handle that data responsibly, and the more comfortable they are with the exchange.\nTo provide a convincing answer to the consumer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d, brands have to deliver empathy at scale by demonstrating a deep understanding of every customer\u2019s (and potential customer\u2019s) needs and the company\u2019s ability to meet those needs. And there\u2019s no better way to speak authentically to the widest possible audience, in the most personal terms, than great creative.\nWith all of the hats they must wear today, it\u2019s fair for marketers to wonder, \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\nBut marketers and agencies can make their jobs simpler and easier on multiple fronts by doing a single thing: embracing automation as a collaborator rather than a competitor. That\u2019s because automation and machine learning can do things that human brains can\u2019t do: connect dots at scale, uncover new insights, free up time across teams, and infuse even more creativity into organizations.\nTake the example of measurement. With so many new content formats, marketers have more data to measure than ever before. But data is only as useful as our ability to interpret and apply it, and automation is a proven tool to drive better performance via modeling.\nAdvertisers are beginning to realize this. Third-party ad technology that supports creativity \u2014 including digital asset management, dynamic creative optimization, advertising attribution, creative applications, and influencer marketing platforms \u2014 saw growth rates ranging from 10% to 30% annually between 2020 and 2021.3\nSo the shift is underway. Of course, automation-enabled measurement doesn\u2019t only make for better creative. Creative thinking can improve the ways we measure.\nToday\u2019s shopping experience extends far outside the store and into the live-streaming, social, and physical worlds.\nAnd as the creator economy flowers across augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming, brands are coming to life across a multiplicity of new dimensions. The implication for brands? Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to convert, and the entire commerce journey is an ever-expanding web of touchpoints where brand building can happen at any time.\nBrands that unlock new ways to stand out in the age of everywhere commerce will define the future of creative advertising.\nWith these ideas as thought-starters, on behalf of our Open Creative Project co-collaborators, we\u2019re excited to open up the conversation to a wider audience. In the coming months, we\u2019ll invite you to dive into a full version of the research report summarized here, followed by a series of contributions from some of the leading voices in creative advertising. We look forward to adding their insights, and more from across the industry, as we endeavor to explore, define, and invent the future of creative, together."

        "output": "Kristen O\u2019Hara is the VP of brand and agency solutions at Google. Here, she spotlights three brands piloting new approaches and stretching their thinking to capture new growth opportunities amid uncertainty.\nIn this current uncertain environment, made more challenging by conflicting news headlines, marketers may have more questions than answers. Strategic decisions tend to get magnified in times like these, and brands often respond by leaning into what they know: tried-and-true advertising tactics that deliver consistent results. While doubling down on what\u2019s familiar is better than doing nothing at all, marketers shouldn\u2019t stop there.\nSearch, video, and insights are tried-and-true advertising channels. Brands know how to leverage them to capture growth and build resilience. But brands also need to supplement their trusted playbooks with the increased insight, speed, and agility that comes from machine learning and automation. We call this combination of tried-and-true approaches and fresh new ways of working the \u201ctried-and-new.\u201d\nHaving served in a variety of roles across the industry, including CMO at Time Warner and chief business officer at Hearst, I\u2019ve experienced challenging times firsthand. Managing the marketing budgets and strategies that many of you hold right now through moments of uncertainty is the moment to focus on purposeful experimentation and lean into the tried-and-new framework. This doesn\u2019t require dramatic changes or major new investments. What it does require is prioritization, flexibility, and a learning mindset. Many leading brands have used this approach to go beyond the performance-oriented tools they\u2019ve relied on in the past to drive better business outcomes. Here are the big takeaways.\nConsumer behaviors, needs, and preferences change from moment to moment, which we see reflected in search. Among the billions of searches on Google everyday, 15% are queries we\u2019ve never seen.1\nWe know that search drives conversions. But with machine learning, you can quickly identify which new searches (or users) are most valuable to your business based on your goals. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve found that full search automation can help advertisers increase conversions by up to 20% for a similar cost per acquisition.2 This is a huge uptick when you are being asked to squeeze more value from every dollar and every campaign.\nWe can see this in action with Rothy\u2019s, a shoe and accessory retailer that relies on video and lifestyle imagery to showcase the quality and colorful nature of their products. The brand adopted automation to surface creative assets to customers at scale across all of Google\u2019s channels, including Search, Display, Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. At first Rothy\u2019s hesitated to automate such important decisions, but \u201cthe results spoke for themselves,\u201d explains Kate Barrows, Rothy\u2019s VP of growth. \u201cAutomation stays on top of customer trends and behavior faster than we can.\u201d The brand grew conversions by 60% and increased revenue by 59%.\nWhat could your brand achieve by offloading commoditized and manual tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work? When you think in those terms, you will begin to see automation as a business multiplier that scales what\u2019s working for your brand, your team, and your partners.\nRemoving tedious tasks, like manually setting your dayparting strategy or building keyword lists, enables your most valuable resource, your people, to infuse more of their own judgment, expertise, and ingenuity into the work. This may mean having the time to focus on building a strategy that expands beyond lower-funnel strategies to develop more holistic, full-funnel marketing campaigns. Or it\u2019s a chance to go deeper on your creative strategy.\nDiscovery+, the streaming platform, adopted Performance Max to improve how it optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. In this case, automation unlocked new audience trends that Discovery+ used to better refine the creative and messaging around their shows. This also freed up time to reinvest into developing a comprehensive media strategy to further drive growth. The strategy worked: Discovery+ increased incremental subscriptions by 17% and decreased cost of acquisition by 21% in a highly competitive category.\nMarketing often suffers from the misperception that it operates as a cost center. Reframing marketing as a growth driver requires speaking a new language, moving beyond proxy metrics like brand awareness or engagement to focus on business performance. Speaking a shared language with the CFO means measuring business outcomes through better use of data, technology, and machine learning.\nWhen you know the value of your customers and you combine that knowledge with AI and machine learning, your campaigns can begin to shift advertising dollars in real time to the most profitable pockets of demand. This is critical, because tying incremental marketing investments to year-over-year sales growth not only increases revenue but also reduces acquisition costs, leading to more profitable revenue. In fact, CMOs who can translate their metrics into business impact are 37% more likely to report revenue growth compared to leaders that communicate strictly in marketing language.3\nFor example, as part of its first-party data strategy, PepsiCo invested in strengthening direct relationships with their consumers by offering a loyalty rewards program that personalizes experiences and optimizes offers based on the individual\u2019s preferences. This enabled their teams to demonstrate results that tied more directly to sales, in contrast with traditional tactics like mass distributions, promotions, and broad communications that were harder to measure. For example, the food and beverage brand embedded its first-party data in its media planning and buying on YouTube. Not only did their media efficiency improve, but for some campaigns ROI increased by 3X. They also leverage this data to make better informed business decisions on new flavor testings, focus groups, and product samplings.\nDelivering continued growth means striking a balance between tested techniques that deliver consistent returns, and the potential upside of new ideas. Brave marketers have long championed this shift. It\u2019s about remaining agile to manage through the now, while being ready for what\u2019s next."

And as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global Chief Marketing Officer, my mission is to accelerate our marketing digital transformation across the entire organization.\nAs a 156-year-old company with more than 2,000 brands \u2014 including icons like Kit Kat, Nespresso, and Purina \u2014 we believe that data and technology, along with our organization\u2019s ability to adopt and activate quickly, are key to maintaining a competitive advantage.\nPart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s success lies in how we\u2019re able to attribute our digital investments to our top and bottom lines. We recently updated our investors on our digital transformation journey by explaining how we\u2019re using data to reach and resonate with consumers at scale, and how that powers growth across our portfolio.\nIn particular, we\u2019ve identified three key areas that are critical to our success and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in: privacy-preserving fundamentals, valuable consumer connections, and ongoing experimentation. Here\u2019s how we approach each one.\nThe first key to our success is a sharp focus on privacy-preserving fundamentals. A critical part of my role as global CMO is to help Nestl\u00e9 navigate the changing advertising landscape, especially as third-party data collection phases out. By treating data protection and privacy as paramount, we've accelerated the use of privacy-preserving technologies across our organization, ensuring that our first-party strategy is future-proof. This means our brands can access high-quality data and continue to deliver personalized experiences online.\nTo drive our privacy strategy, we\u2019ve developed and delivered a global advertising-technology roadmap across all our markets and brands. Doing so has helped us take advantage of privacy features, like consent mode within Google Analytics 4 (GA4), through which we can communicate users\u2019 cookie- and app-identifier consent status to Google. Tags will then automatically adjust behavior and respect users\u2019 choices. In turn, we\u2019re able to safely improve our understanding of consumers across platforms and deliver richer experiences online.\nLastly, we recognize that staying up-to-date on new privacy capabilities requires us to invest in upskilling programs for our talented teams of brand builders around the world. By empowering our marketers to deeply understand the impact and value a technology unlocks, we can accelerate our transformation and put our company on the path to competitive advantage.\nOur second key focus is on building and fostering valuable consumer connections. In particular, our goal is to reach 400 million consumers with our first-party database by 2025. Having direct access to our first-party data \u2014 and turning this data into actionable insight \u2014 is a critical competitive advantage with immediate value for our brands.\nBy moving toward a first-party, data-driven approach and leveraging Google\u2019s privacy-preserving advertising and analytics tools, we\u2019ve increased our ability to offer personalized solutions in real time, track ROI, and improve sales performance. This ultimately helps us make smarter investments, especially amid economic uncertainty, when it is more critical than ever to understand the value of media spend.\nOne powerful example of this is our food brand Maggi\u2019s use of first-party data to inform dynamic ad creative and better connect with consumers in the Middle East during seasonal moments and other special occasions. By taking this approach, the Maggi team improved its return on ad spend by 25%.\nAnother example is how we leverage new audience capabilities to derive value from our first-party data. Solutions such as Google\u2019s advanced look-alike modeling, currently available in beta, gives us more transparency and control when building audience segments by combining our first-party data with Google\u2019s consumer intent signals. Already, this technology has improved our media efficiency and helped drive a 25% uplift in ad recall for one of our pet care brands in the U.K.\nOur final key focus is on experimentation and fostering a culture of experimentation across our marketing teams. To do this, we lean heavily on cloud capabilities that give us the flexibility to try new technologies while strengthening consumer privacy and growing our first-party data. Our \u201cCloud-in-a-Box\u201d program, for example, gives our brands scalable blueprints to unlock the value of machine learning and other predictive technology.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice for our market-leading Nescaf\u00e9 coffee brand in Thailand. Using Cloud-in-a-Box, the Nescaf\u00e9 team routed large volumes of past campaign data to Google Cloud, then used machine learning to predict which creative messages paired with which audiences to deliver the best results on YouTube.\nBy taking this approach, Nescaf\u00e9 improved its cost per view by 17% and invested the money it saved to reach additional audiences, all while boosting ad recall 12%. Most importantly, the team saw up to 90% accuracy in the model\u2019s predictions, when compared with outcomes from the actual campaign.\nBuilding brands that consumers love remains our core marketing ambition. Our continued investment in digital transformation focuses us on understanding and using the power of data and technology to fuel growth potential for tomorrow.\nBy driving a consistent global marketing strategy across the organization, our team has been able to drive change at scale, embracing data and technology to build competitiveness. Our strategic priorities are helping us build resilience through uncertainty, positioning Nestl\u00e9 to achieve long-term growth."

        "output": "Changes are afoot in how people spend their money. Consumers are being more intentional with purchases, making fewer impulse buys, considering more brands, and exploring multiple commerce platforms. Businesses need to move quickly to keep up with this swerve in shopper mindsets, but it can be hard to put change into action amid uncertainty.\nFinding the right balance between tested strategies and emerging tech innovations can revitalize marketing approaches and power long-term growth. At Google, we call this the tried-and-new approach. It\u2019s about doubling down on proven tactics while leaning into new technology to drive success.\nWhat does this look like in practice? We\u2019ve identified a few strategies that position businesses to adopt the tried-and-new, along with examples of two innovative companies that are using Google\u2019s tools to pivot their growth marketing strategy.\nPeople spend more time researching purchase decisions than they once did, and they\u2019re conducting this research across a growing array of platforms. With this change, automation tools have become a critical way for brands to meet their customers across these digital touchpoints.\nA good example of this comes from Est\u00e9e Lauder in Thailand. Despite being one of the world\u2019s largest cosmetic brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder was challenged to keep up with customer search demand as new search queries and keyword combinations emerged daily. People were no longer just searching for terms like \u201cserum,\u201d but new specific searches like \u201cbest serum for the best price\u201d and \u201cbest serum for brightening skin.\u201d\nThe company decided to approach the problem using automation. To capture and convert prospective customers at scale, Est\u00e9e Lauder used Google\u2019s broad match to automate identification of consumers\u2019 keyword searches to make their ads more relevant to prospective customers. The company also adopted Dynamic Search Ads to find exactly what consumers were searching for on Google and used that data to target their ads and fill gaps in their keyword-based campaigns.\nAs a result, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s media performance shot up. Compared to traditional branded keyword campaigns, the company experienced a 15% increase in return on ad spend, a more than 16% rise in conversion value, and an 11% lift in average purchase size.\nKnowing how to reach the most valuable customers and others like them at scale is a powerful growth multiplier. Using automated solutions allows businesses to do this, while controlling what they pay for customer acquisition and tailoring messages to attract customer attention.\nMarketers know they need to measure what matters, but what are the most important metrics when the economic outlook is in flux? Uncertainty signals the need to move beyond traditional proxy marketing metrics and toward the measurement of real business outcomes.\nArizona State University (ASU) had a business goal to enroll more online students for the 2022\u20132023 school year than the year prior \u2014 no small aim given years of declining enrollment across U.S. postsecondary institutions.\nTo drive this outcome, ASU partnered with Google data scientists to use advanced automation solutions in combination with first-party data to identify people who were most likely to enroll at the institution.\nBut ASU needed to embrace new measurement in order to track the results of these solutions and track progress against its goal. The university leaned in to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and adopted Google Tag Manager\u2019s (GTM) server-side tracking. This allowed ASU to measure the results of its first-party targeting, resulting in a 10% increase in observable conversions on its site and an 8% increase in the on-page conversion rate. Adopting GTM tagging also drove a 25% improvement in page load time and 18% improvement in search engine results page position.\nThis increase in conversions drove remarkable impact. For the 2022 fall semester, ASU Online increased enrollment by 6.9% compared to 2021, setting a record for incoming students.\nNew automation solutions handily harnessed the scale of platforms, helping ASU reach the people who were most likely to act at lower cost. And it was able to measure and track this progress in real time using privacy-safe solutions within GA4.\nPreparing for what\u2019s next is always daunting \u2014 and all the more during times of rapid change.\nBut new marketing strategy tools available today can help to augment traditional strategies, deliver reliable results, and drive long-term growth, no matter what disruptions surface. Use the tried-and-new and make your marketing go further."

The power of the human voice is a great way to connect with people, and it can add personality through your choice of talent and delivery style.\nIncorporate multiple branding opportunities to get noticed and be remembered. Frequency plus variety is key. From logo to tagline and mascots to pack shots, more points of branding will give you more impact.\nAs humans, we can\u2019t help but be drawn to other humans. So featuring people in your story lends emotional context to scenes and creates connection quickly. Showing people using your product is one proven way to demonstrate its benefits. Celebrities and influencers can also inspire engagement, as can reflecting the diversity of the real world.\nJust as in the core ABCDs, make sure your ad gives people clear and simple instructions.\nNow compare the Awareness version of the ad with the version based on the general ABCDs.

        "input": "",
        "output": "People encounter more sustainability-related brand messages than ever, and with good reason: According to a recent Harris Poll survey sponsored by Google Cloud, the vast majority (85%) of executives acknowledge that customers are more likely to engage and do business with sustainable brands. Brand commitments to sustainability have proliferated, with sustainability marketing strategies amplifying those commitments \u2014 on food packaging, in car ads, even on energy bills. That means people see a ton of messages about the environment throughout the day. Those messages represent many opportunities to appeal to customers\u2019 values. How they are conveyed is critical to building brand trust.\nWe asked more than 3,000 Americans of different backgrounds to tell us about sustainability messaging that did not resonate with them to get a better understanding of how to connect on this important issue. Using a type of AI called natural language processing, we clustered and analyzed thousands of opinions by theme to identify how people felt about certain visuals, copy, and creative approaches. Here are three of the most common sustainability marketing pitfalls our research revealed.\nU.S. survey respondents knew which parts of their day-to-day consumption were environmentally unsustainable, citing things like plastic use and driving, but they expressed frustration when they couldn\u2019t afford to change their habits.1\n\u201cI wanted to start using compostable and plastic-free products but could not afford them.\u201d\n\u201cI feel helpless when considering the impact of fossil fuel consumption. I can\u2019t help driving my car when I need to.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to buy an EV, but cannot afford it. I would also like solar panels, cannot afford those either.\u201d\nEducational campaigns can have limited or negative impact when they become constant reminders of barriers to change. Awareness of a sustainability-related problem is rarely the sole cause of inaction. Many people today understand their environmental impact and want to do something about it, but not everyone is in a position to opt into a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, paper straws, though better for the environment, are not universally accessible. Walking or taking the bus to work isn\u2019t always feasible. Meanwhile, some sustainable options can be hard to find or more expensive than the default.\nTo avoid this pitfall, highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are also cost or timesaving. Such \u201cco-benefits\u201d of climate action enable people to make the best choices for their own specific sets of circumstances. Case in point: Google Maps now shows the most fuel-efficient routes, which are often the fastest. Interest in fuel efficiency has grown globally over the past year.2 By integrating sustainability into existing products, brands can enhance people\u2019s lifestyles, rather than interrupt or criticize them. Social proof is a powerful motivator, but research shows people underestimate just how many others are taking environmental action. To remedy this, we created a website for Earth Day that highlights climate actions that have gained traction over the last few years and a variety of steps people can take toward adoption.\nWhile dramatic images of destroyed environments may emphasize the urgency of global action, they may also be overwhelming to individuals. When asked to describe \u201cactions or attitudes that could make people feel bad about their impact on the environment,\u201d many U.S. survey respondents pointed to images of landscapes ruined by trash, fires, or pollution, while some pointed to images of animal suffering.3\nDepicting the severity of an issue through poignant creative is a common way to engage people in a cause. Conveying the size of the problem with great urgency should, in theory, motivate people to act. While this may be effective for certain causes, it can sometimes be detrimental to others. Illustrating a massive phenomenon like climate change can easily overwhelm people and decrease feelings of individual efficacy.4\n\u201cI\u2019m only one person. I can\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing pictures and videos of the giant garbage pile in the ocean that is now bigger than the state of Texas ... made my stomach hurt. But I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI always feel bad when I see the changing climate\u2019s effect on animals. \u2026 I feel a little helpless.\u201d\nBrands and companies still have a place when it comes to helping people make positive changes in their daily lives. They just have to put those contributions in context. Rather than depict the harrowing consequences of inaction, focus instead on concrete, small-scale actions that add up to visible improvements. Even one-time changes that lessen impact over time \u2014 such as replacing light bulbs with LEDs \u2014 can empower customers to participate.\nConsider using before-and-after visualizations that show the value of individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 combined efforts. Time-lapse videos can illustrate outcomes in powerful ways. Such visuals show that we haven\u2019t gone past a point of no return and that measures to address the problem can still be effective. Reporting an initiative\u2019s success to date can also make people want to be a part of the solution.\nPeople may react negatively to being told what to do by brands. This type of purpose-driven advertising can be met with skepticism, with some viewing it as greenwashing. Many U.S. survey respondents pointed to insufficient evidence as a barrier to believing a company\u2019s sustainability claims.5\n\u201cMost of the time [sustainable messaging] is just greenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they can show proof [of] what they\u2019re doing to protect the environment, I don\u2019t fully believe it.\u201d\nThe sentiments align with results from a global survey of top-level executives that had nearly 6 out of 10 (59%) admitting to overstating \u2014 or inaccurately representing \u2014 their sustainability activities. Reporting hard metrics can be an effective inoculation against exaggeration. If you are able to substantiate the value of your offerings, those who care about the cause might consider your proposition. At the very least, they might do some research on their end to learn more about your brand and its climate action goals.\nEffective sustainability marketing and messaging is all about delivering reliable information to help people make better choices in the context of their lives. It\u2019s also about unearthing essential data so that people can gauge and compare the impact of different offerings. For retailers, this might mean introducing features that highlight brands carrying Energy Star-certified products, allowing shoppers to filter for energy-efficient options with a single click.\nThe climate crisis is an urgent matter and individual changes to our lifestyles and behavior have an impact. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve \u201cglobal net-zero\u201d by 2050 are linked to consumer choices.6\nWhile businesses and governments have an opportunity to lead the charge, they also have a critical role to play in making sustainable living more accessible and inclusive for all \u2014 by considering the multifaceted lives of customers who are already well aware of the changes they want to make."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Kelsey Davis, founder and CEO of Cllctve, a global community portfolio platform that helps brands discover and connect with creators, shares how Black creators are at the forefront of the shifting content landscape, and how brands can credit Black creativity beyond Black History Month. Davis has been featured as a next-gen leader in Forbes 30 Under 30, Adweek, and The New York Times, and is a recipient of the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund.\nGrowing up in Atlanta, I\u2019ve always been interested in the ways business and media converge, especially when it comes to Black culture. Studying video production in high school led me to make so many short films for the Y that they hired me as a freelancer. Local projects like these gave me more visibility and credibility in my community as a video producer. A friend helped me land my first gig with a Fortune 500 brand as a video producer for the Raurfest music festival. The success of the festival led to a meeting with executives at festival sponsor Coca-Cola to talk about my vision for future projects.\nAfter scaling productions early in Atlanta, I started studying film and entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. By my sophomore year, I had traveled the country working on creative projects with major brands, like Puma, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Land Rover, juggling high-profile projects with being a full-time student, finding a job, and building my personal brand as a freelance content creator. It was overwhelming, but I soon realized I was not alone. Many talented students wanted to build their portfolios and monetize their craft. They just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nI saw an opportunity to simplify the gig-finding and on-ramping processes so that young creators could turn their hobbies and passions into careers. From working with marketers, I knew that giving brands a way to discover and manage creator partnerships in one place could be game-changing. That\u2019s what led me to launch Cllctve, a portfolio platform that connects creators with their next opportunity and helps brands easily find and connect with Gen Z voices.\nThe content landscape is changing rapidly, and streaming is at the forefront. Digital video content is much more accessible to consumers, with a range of video lengths, types of content, and production quality. Over the past five years, there\u2019s been a significant rise in digital video-on-demand content as more consumers become creators of content as well. The more tools platforms give people to express themselves, the more content people will create, including branded content. Platforms like YouTube exemplify the cyclical relationship between consuming and creating content.\nThis is the age of the creator economy. At Cllctve, we believe that every human is a creator. We imagine a future where everyone has access to the tools, resources, and network to create the life they want. While many monetization avenues continue to grow, 77% of creators still depend on brand deals for revenue. And brands are looking for talent to help them produce their next campaigns.\nHistorically, Black creators have been among the leading spheres of influence driving the content economy forward. Whether it\u2019s through the storytelling of legendary writers like Toni Morrison, the choreography of revolutionary artists like Alvin Ailey, or the countless innovators of collective movements across genre and craft, Black creators have always achieved their creative visions by using their gifts to create through media that reaches the masses. 2015 proved to be a tipping point, when consumer data caught up to producer impact, and the results showed the influence of Black creators on the content landscape in real time. Black people are also some of the fastest to adopt streaming services. To move into representation beyond Black History Month, brands need to expand the types of Black talent they feature, pay Black creators equitably, and credit them for their contributions.\nBrands need to scout early and often for Black talent, expanding their search to places and people that are often overlooked. The increase in creator-economy activity nationwide gives brands the opportunity to look outside the traditional markets of New York and Los Angeles for talent. Given that the media has the potential to influence so much of how we see ourselves, brands need to expand representation beyond celebrities to emerging creators who deserve to be known. While it can feel more comfortable to reach out to the same circles, it\u2019s important for marketing teams to go beyond the usual roster to find young, diverse talent. Cllctve helps them find this talent by giving Gen Z creators a way to be discovered by brands trying to connect authentically with young audiences. One of the creators on our platform is based in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been able to work with local and national brands to produce content for them remotely, while staying close to his family.\nCompensation is a critical part of hiring the best talent, yet it\u2019s too often overlooked. The creator-economy wage gap between Black and white workers is disheartening, at 35%. This shows that when brands do decide to hire Black creators, it\u2019s at a significantly lower price point than their white counterparts. Even though the data shows that Black viewership is a leading driver of growth, the value these companies choose to invest in Black creators betrays a willingness to profit from Black art while underpaying Black artists.\nThe key to closing this gap is transparency. At Cllctve, we talk openly about how creators can think about pricing, and we encourage our creators to post their rates on their profile so there are no surprises when they connect with brands. We also provide prompts to help both brands and creators start the conversation. It\u2019s important to me that creators have the tools and resources that they need to feel empowered, and that brands know as much information upfront to streamline conversations. That way, everyone gets value out of the partnership.\nFinancial compensation is important, but so is crediting and celebrating Black creatives. Giving credit can look different depending on the project. Often it means using your platform to elevate Black creativity. One brand that actively seeks to credit both Black creators and Black businesses is Target. In a recent series called Convos with CEOs, Target partnered with YouTube Creator Hallease to highlight the stories behind the CEOs of four different Black-owned brands at Target. With over an hour of original content, the campaign garnered 6.4 million views, 20% higher than benchmarks.\nWhile it\u2019s great to use February as a time to prioritize these initiatives, investing in broad and systemic representation of creators should be a year-round effort. To make good on promises to drive equity, brands must embed it into the DNA of their businesses. And that means scouting, paying, and crediting Black creators."

Since YouTube offers a breadth of ways for music fans to tap into their passions, the marketing team tapped into the platform to reach engaged audiences.\nTo fully demonstrate Ariya\u2019s duality \u2014 that of a serene, Japanese-inspired cabin combined with the thrilling torque of an electric vehicle \u2014 Nissan opted to experiment with YouTube\u2019s popular lo-fi trend, consisting of music videos with chill hip-hop beats and stripped-back production.\nInspired by a popular creator called Lofi Girl, Nissan created its own four-hour lo-fi video, complete with a 15-track playlist and whimsical animation. While creating hourslong content might be considered risky, Nissan felt confident that YouTube viewers would be receptive. As Allyson Witherspoon, Nissan\u2019s global CMO, explains, \u201cIn launching the all-electric Ariya, we looked to build awareness and consideration in ways that could match the vehicle in being exceptionally creative, unique, and trend-leading. That\u2019s where YouTube came in. It gave us the creative canvas to innovate and authentically connect with our audience.\u201d\nNissan ran its lo-fi video across screens using skippable in-stream ads to drive efficient reach, along with a roadblock on Lofi Girl\u2019s channel to increase the video\u2019s share of voice. The team also used a diverse mix of music lineups to surround the campaign with related content, engage new audiences, and meet passionate music lovers already primed for listening across screens.\nIn its first month, the video drew over 7 million views and thousands of positive comments. It earned an impressive average watch time of 15 minutes across all devices, and 19 minutes on connected TV (CTV) specifically. The campaign\u2019s impact proves that with the right creative, the right trend, and the right platform, even the longest-form content can engage audiences across screens.\nInternational fitness brand Les Mills had the goal of increasing sign ups for its Les Mills+ at-home fitness app. To achieve it, the brand sought to make exercise \u2014 an intimidating concept for many consumers \u2014 feel more accessible. This made short, made-for-mobile video the ideal format. And, with YouTube Shorts averaging over 50 billion daily views (as of January 2023),2 Les Mills put Shorts at the center of its plan.\nFor ad creative, the brand repurposed short-form, vertical video content previously developed for social media. Next, the Les Mills team ran a mix of vertical and horizontal Video action campaigns to encourage lower-funnel audiences to sign up for the Les Mills+ app. This approach ensured that viewers would receive the most suitable aspect ratio, regardless of device.\nUltimately, the campaign exceeded expectations by generating a 52% increase in click-through rate, while reducing cost; Les Mills saw a 10% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 16% decrease in cost per impression. And, while people tuned in on a variety of devices, 24% of impressions were generated from views on mobile phones, supporting the team\u2019s strategy to build with mobile in mind.\nAs Michael Fitzpatrick, marketing manager at Les Mills, explains, \u201cIncorporating vertical video has enabled us to reach incremental audiences during their different watch states and, ultimately, drive more people to work out with us on Les Mills+.\u201d His team\u2019s successful approach shows that using multiple formats helps marketers meet customers where they\u2019re consuming content and drive the results they seek.\nFor centuries, winery brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has been known for its prestigious, high-end Champagne. More recently, however, the company has sought to increase brand desirability by expanding its core audience. For the marketing team, this meant a rejuvenation of brand content, with a modern twist. Taking a cue from the popular how-to trend on YouTube, they created The Perfect Serve, a tutorial series aimed at making Champagne culture appeal to a new generation.\nThis series included long-form videos, along with shorter, bite-sized teaser videos. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s creative best practices, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon designed its shorter videos to run as attention-grabbing in-stream ads to attract viewers to its \u201cThe Perfect Serve\u201d YouTube playlist.\nWith creative assets ready, the team considered screens. Since reaching people in multiple watching environments was important, they made a bold choice to run two different campaigns; one meant for viewers specifically streaming YouTube on their CTVs and another that focused on all other devices.\nWhile the two campaigns used the same creative assets, the CTV campaign helped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon marry its engaging tutorials with a screen designed to be immersive and proved to be effective. According to our recent study with Latitude, viewers agree that ads on YouTube CTV are more relevant (59%), unique (55%), informative (52%), and enjoyable (51%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3\nBoth campaigns performed exceptionally well, but the CTV effort was the most successful with viewers. Compared to the campaign targeting other devices, it drove more than double the ad recall, demonstrating how brands can use CTV to bolster their media strategies and connect with passionate audiences.\n\u201cThe emergence of CTV on YouTube shows us how message and format are intrinsically linked,\u2019\u2019 says Karen Valesella, digital marketing and communications director at Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u2018\u2019Whether it\u2019s very short or very long formats, YouTube offers us a wide range of possibilities to meet all our needs.\u201d Citing its impressive results, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has incorporated CTV into the brand\u2019s broader strategy.\nNissan took a chance on a four-hour lo-fi video to drive excitement for its electric vehicle, while Les Mills successfully increased sign-ups with short-form fitness content. And Mo\u00ebt & Chandon experimented with different formats to boost their brand appeal, ultimately striking gold with their CTV campaign. These campaigns proved how multiformat videos on YouTube can help brands tell their stories and reach the world\u2019s largest video-viewing audience at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way."

        "input": "",
        "output": "YouTube is the top streaming destination for viewers of all generations. Senior leaders from media agency Carat share how brands should approach the platform to connect with audiences and drive results.\nAs people of all generations spend less time watching TV1 and more time online,2 it\u2019s increasingly clear that YouTube is now their top choice among streaming and social platforms.3\nViewers come to YouTube for many reasons: to immerse themselves in their favorite worlds through deep-dive content, to catch a new video from their favorite creator, or to find in-depth commentary and analysis. A top reason audiences tune into the No. 1 most-watched streaming platform in America4 is to rewind relevant events5 and discover thoughtful perspectives in a media environment that sometimes sacrifices depth for velocity. This is according to recent research on viewer trends from media agency Carat, youth culture agency Archrival, and Google.\nThis same study demonstrated two other noteworthy insights. First, audiences appreciate having the agency to search for and choose YouTube videos that bring them joy.6 They\u2019re not just passing time watching the latest trends served up on social media. Instead, they consider the minutes and hours on YouTube to be time well spent. Second, a majority of viewers agree that creators are the reason they visit YouTube. This is especially true of Gen Z.7\nThese insights reinforce YouTube\u2019s indispensability to users and present a huge opportunity for advertisers to increase engagement with their audiences. For more on YouTube\u2019s place in viewers\u2019 lives and its significance to advertisers, we asked three agency executives from Carat to share their perspective on how brands can make the most of the unique engagement and relevance that YouTube offers.\nYouTube enables us to place people at the heart of our media approach. The platform offers powerful opportunities for brands to understand the behaviors, preferences, and cultural trends of their target audiences and then use those insights to map consumer journeys and optimize campaign performance at every stage.\nWe know, for instance, that YouTube has unparalleled influence among Gen Z viewers and that 68% of Gen Z audiences agree creators are why they keep returning to YouTube.8 This creator-driven content lets brands establish authentic connections with their audiences, inspire action, and achieve sustained growth.\nYouTube is a launchpad for myriad ideas, making it a valuable platform for brands. Users trust YouTube to provide answers and inspiration; it\u2019s the starting point and endpoint of their online experience.\nYouTube\u2019s large creator community and crowdsourcing aspects contribute to the wealth of content available and provide diverse opportunities for consumer engagement. By tapping into thoughtful perspectives, curating time well spent, and fostering creator connections, we guide brands to make the most of YouTube\u2019s unique engagement and opportunities for relevance. We ensure that brands show up where viewers have always been watching, reflecting what truly matters to them.\nPeople go to YouTube to engage with topics they are passionate about and search for different perspectives. Core users will go even deeper than casual users, journeying through the platform for a variety of opinions. YouTube is not just entertainment for them; it broadens how they see the world and think about key issues.\nYouTube\u2019s role in the media ecosystem has started to shift. As connected TV has started to feel more traditional and social media has become unpredictable, YouTube now seems to sit in a sweet spot between the two. YouTube offers users more control and searchability than social platforms, but the content still feels fresh, unconstrained by the rigid formats associated with TV. Brands should lean into these strengths. By doing so, they can still drive reach within topics of interest, maintain the freedom to play with format, and offer unique perspectives audiences can\u2019t get elsewhere."

        "output": "The final weeks of the year provide a natural opportunity to reflect on the world around us and plan for the future. As 2021 has been another year of change driven by disruptive external events, the year\u2019s top videos \u2014 viewed by 2 billion people across more than 100 countries \u2014 reflect that reality.\nYouTube\u2019s Culture and Trends team reviewed the top videos from creators from around the globe and saw three themes emerge \u2014 community, comfort, and creativity \u2014 that offer a glimpse into what people are watching and what 2022 might hold. Together these themes not only encapsulate where we are today, but speak to broader shifts in society. From a marketing standpoint, these global insights can help brands understand what people are looking for and how best to reach them.\n\u201cGaming\u201d used to be a subculture, but with 2.9 billion people expected to play video games by the end of this year, today it\u2019s clearly pop culture. The $175 billion industry also has a diverse consumer base, with women making up 46% of gamers and 10% of gamers identifying as LGBTQ+.\nGaming\u2019s primacy is reflected in this year\u2019s Top 10 lists. Players from around the world have taken gaming to the next level, using game elements to craft narratives that spark viewer obsession akin to a must-see TV series. YouTube\u2019s most viewed game, \u201cMinecraft,\u201d featured prominently in two of the top trending videos, receiving more than 100 million combined views. YouTube\u2019s most viewed new game, a rhythm game called \u201cFriday Night Funkin\u201d that\u2019s reminiscent of early 2000s craze \u201cDance Dance Revolution,\u201d made the list with an entry from Cory Kenshin. And speaking of nostalgia, another dominant video, Game Night Stereotypes from top creators Dude Perfect, hilariously portrays a cast of characters often encountered playing board games.\nSource: Newzoo, Global Games Market to Generate $175.8 Billion in 2021; Despite a Slight Decline, the Market Is on Track to Surpass $200 Billion in 2023, May 6, 2021.\nFor many creators and viewers, engaging with game content offers a way to engage with each other, whether through live streaming or on their own time. With the huge cultural zeitgeist around gaming, marketers are finding creative ways to tap into this community. Nintendo debuted its new OLED model, highlighting different games and ways to play, earning a spot on the 2021 end-of-year YouTube ads leaderboard. Among other brand integrations, Balenciaga collaborated with Fortnite, Lil Nas X performed for Roblox, and Puma and ColourPop partnered with Animal Crossing.\nThe past two years have been defined by global political and social instability with little ability to guess the future beyond next week. Perhaps in response to this extended period of uncertainty, people around the world engaged in comfort viewing by seeking out the familiar.\nFor instance, some of this year\u2019s top trending videos from around the world are newer versions of videos that previously resonated with viewers. Back by popular demand, Sidemen created a third installment of their \u201cTinder in Real Life\u201d series, while Mark Rober reprised his 2020 backyard squirrel maze with an even more challenging obstacle course.\nJust as familiar content brings a sense of comfort, so does comedy. Many of 2021\u2019s most popular comedy videos centered on relatable, true-to-life events. This video from Canadian creator Jeenie.Weenie, one in a series about her experience as a flight attendant dealing with different types of passengers, has more than 8 million views.\nOther top videos provided a comic twist on the journalistic interview format. Two students interviewed German rapper Shirin David about her lyrics, and U.K. creator Niko Omilana cleverly convinced BBC News to interview him, while also encouraging people to vote. Taking note of the types of content people are engaging with and looking for \u2014 both comfort and comedy \u2014 can help marketers meet consumers where they are with messages that resonate, which is important in times of uncertainty.\nWhereas audiences have embraced long-form videos on familiar themes, short-form video has become a laboratory for new storytelling formats. Hybrid creators who produce YouTube Shorts alongside their long-form videos have illustrated how quick bites can give audiences a novel experience. Chef Nick DiGiovanni\u2019s long-form videos resemble the food content trend that dominated the first 20 years of this century. But his short-form recipes rely on a quirkier, more playful editing style. By creating for both formats, Nick can bake his cake and eat it too.\nSome creators \u2014 like Chingu amiga, a Korean woman living in Mexico \u2014 use short-form videos to highlight cultural nuances. And others share motivational messages and interesting facts. We see this with Indian creator A2 Motivation, whose bite-sized videos and channel have collectively garnered over 6 billion views. By giving us another view of their worlds, Shorts offer an expanded way for creators to connect with audiences.\nFor marketers, sometimes short and sweet works well, whether that\u2019s giving people a look behind the scenes or demonstrating a new way to use your product. Japanese restaurant Horumon Shimata went viral with a warning video showing that dangerously hot car temperatures are capable of cooking raw meat. The brand regularly posts behind-the-scenes food videos that subtly promote the restaurant to diners.\nAs we reflected on 2021, themes of community, comfort, and creativity popped up repeatedly in the videos YouTubers around the world chose to watch. These are not fleeting trends, but broader indicators of the kinds of content consumers need and the creators they love. Marketers who embrace these themes in their video and ad creative will evolve with their viewers and connect with key audiences in the moments that matter."

        "output": "David Mataranglo is the U.S. CEO at Reprise Digital, a performance marketing company. Here, he shares how to create an agile business that\u2019s ready to tackle today\u2019s challenges and be prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow by focusing your marketing on customer behaviors.\nClosing out this calendar year, businesses are likely realizing that uncertainty is the only certainty. A parade of headlines \u2014 covering labor shortages, supply chain delays, inflation, and uncertain financial markets \u2014 dominate the news and suggest that volatility will persist. As a result, changes in consumer behavior will likely continue, sending a clear signal to brands: Adapt or be left behind.\nAt Reprise Digital, we help ensure that the brands we work with are agile and ready for whatever the future holds. We do this by focusing on how consumers move along the path to purchase, and analyzing and assessing those behaviors holistically, rather than in siloed channels. This approach allows brands to design their marketing around consumer behaviors, which positions them to thrive, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nA great example of this is the work we\u2019ve done with dermocosmetic skin care brand NEOSTRATA and its e-commerce strategy.\nOperating a direct-to-consumer business model, the company sought to efficiently drive traffic and online sales despite having limited awareness. In partnership with Reprise, NEOSTRATA piloted a new approach using Performance Max, which leverages automation to optimize Google and YouTube campaigns in real time. More specifically, this helped the brand hit its predetermined goals by identifying the right ad creative and the right ad placement to reach the customers most likely to convert.\nThe campaign\u2019s results speak for themselves: When comparing three months of Performance Max data to the previous three months of standard Shopping campaigns, NEOSTRATA saw a 91% increase in revenue at a 65% increase in spend, all while increasing efficiency 16%.\nWhile every brand is unique and will see different results, you can follow this example \u2014 and deliver consumer-centric marketing while staying agile \u2014 by employing three key steps. First, enhance your first-party data strategy. Then use automation to optimize your marketing for the right customers. And finally, build a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience.\nAs the economy tightens, many brands are tempted to shift their advertising focus to performance and results. With increased scrutiny on ROI, marketing teams will need to work smarter, using data to achieve greater scale and better outcomes without sacrificing effectiveness. This requires having a sustainable first-party data strategy in place.\nFirst-party data can create new value for your marketing, improve ad performance, and help you deepen relationships with your customers. To build a strong strategy, it\u2019s critical to know exactly what data you need to collect from customers and have a clear plan for how it will be used. For example, NEOSTRATA identified its website visitors, particularly those who did not make a purchase, as a crucial audience to help drive the highest quality leads.\nAs you develop your strategy, keep in mind that value exchange is paramount. You must give your customers something of value in return for their consented data, such as early access to new product launches, personalized recommendations, exclusive products, and other unique offers.\nIn times of volatility, brands should shift their focus away from generalized outcomes, like the number of clicks, toward customers who are the most valuable and profitable. And because customer journeys are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to measure, leveraging automation is increasingly important.\nWith automation, it\u2019s possible to focus your campaign reach on those online customers who are most likely to shop with your brand. Tools like Performance Max, for instance, allow you to promote products across a range of channels, and ensure that you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. This capability becomes even more powerful when you\u2019re able to combine it with first-party data you\u2019ve collected and build lists of people who may be interested in your products.\nAutomation becomes even more significant when you factor in nuances like fluctuating demand across markets, because it can keep pace with shifting consumer behavior faster than a manual, human-led process. In this way, automation can be a particularly vital device for keeping your business agile and ready to react to changes in real time.\nWe certainly saw this with NEOSTRATA. Using Performance Max, the marketing team was able to optimize their Google Shopping feed, regularly rotate ad copy and collateral, and develop a complete set of audience signals, like website visitors and purchases used to target new customers. And all of this was done at scale and across new formats like video, which is crucial for driving conversions across a full-funnel strategy.\nIncreasingly, brands need to think beyond in-store versus online, linear versus digital marketing, or mid-funnel versus lower-funnel conversions and embrace a more connected, omnichannel customer experience. Indeed, a recent survey by McKinsey found that 75% of U.S. consumers say they\u2019re going both online and into stores to research and buy products across categories.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? A fully connected customer experience collapses the traditional marketing funnel and authentically reflects how people are actually shopping today. For example, people increasingly use the internet to discover new products and often end up buying products immediately after researching them. So what has traditionally been an upper-funnel activity is now also a purchasing opportunity through various shoppable media. This means that every connection you make is a chance to acquire a new customer.\nDuring the past couple of years, NEOSTRATA focused on expanding their approach from selling products mainly in dermatology offices to selling directly to consumers. That meant the brand needed to create experiences that make it easier for customers to convert throughout the funnel, whether they were comparing different skin care products through Search or discovering the brand for the first time on YouTube. In fact, combining search and video is especially important, as research shows that YouTube advertisers see brand videos driving 28% of their conversion assists.1\nAmid a volatile economic forecast, it\u2019s more important than ever for your businesses to adapt and stay agile. You can set yourself up for success by developing a smart first-party data strategy, leveraging automation to find the most valuable customers and creating a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience. With these tactics, your business can drive growth now and capitalize on new opportunities in the future."

        "output": "A version of this article first appeared on the YouTube Blog on February 27, 2023.\nEquity and inclusion are at the forefront of YouTube\u2019s mission. Upholding it means that our teams are constantly exploring how our norms, practices, and policies may inadvertently create bias and inequity on the platform.\nThis is why, in 2020, we established a dedicated Racial Justice, Equity, and Product Inclusion team to ensure that the voices of historically underrepresented communities were incorporated early into the development of our products and protocols. Since then, one of the team\u2019s core programs \u2014 called the Inclusion Working Group (IWG) \u2014 has played a critical role in embedding equity into YouTube\u2019s platform and business.\nWe created the IWG as a resource to help our employees consider key risks and opportunities during the development of new products, processes, and policies. It consists of a dedicated product inclusion lead, executive sponsors, employee resource group (ERG) representatives, and leaders from across YouTube \u2014 including experts in machine learning and responsible AI.\nWhile we have a long way to go, the IWG has been a significant step forward in YouTube\u2019s commitment to driving equality. We also acknowledge the power of sharing our progress, with the hope that it can help inspire others to tackle inequality with us, together.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re eager to share three key things that have helped the IWG succeed.\nBeing user first is core to everything we do at YouTube, and it\u2019s imperative that our users see themselves and their lived experiences reflected in our products and policies.\nDelivering on this requires teams to consider equity and inclusion early and often in the development process, so they have time to identify and mitigate risks, and adjust direction when necessary. The IWG makes this possible.\nThe group partners directly with teams to understand how they plan to use machine learning, whether facets of identity are considered in their products, whether new launches may lead to undue hate and harassment, and more.\nAlready, we\u2019ve seen the IWG\u2019s contributions help teams improve a range of projects and programs. For example, it directly influenced the creation of new safety protocols for the first-ever all-female broadcast of a Major League Baseball game last summer. The IWG also helped improve how we detect racially insensitive comments on YouTube, prepared our teams to better identify and respond to new forms of online hate, and provided constant advocacy for the safety and diverse representation of Creators in product launches.\nBy design, the IWG gets its strength from its members \u2014 a consultative, cross-functional team of professionals that span YouTube\u2019s product areas, varied ERGs, and its executive leadership.\nIn addition to its members\u2019 vast expertise and experience, executive sponsorship and buy-in are essential to formalize and champion the IWG\u2019s role. The group helps to mitigate risk and improve the overall quality of product launches by assembling voices from across multiple functions and underrepresented groups to consider questions of inclusion.\nTo date, the IWG has partnered with YouTube teams on over 900 projects. In 2023, the program will expand its coverage to 100% of YouTube\u2019s product teams and range of collaborators. It will also provide guidance on how to prioritize equity across product strategy and to increase visibility among teams. Additionally, the IWG will focus on educating teams by sharing learnings from case studies, research, frameworks, and other content to continue driving scalable ways of thinking equity-first.\nWhile this work will take time and thoughtful discussion, we are motivated by the ways it will benefit the entire YouTube ecosystem for years to come.

        "output": "Flying cars may have been a sign of the times on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d but in real life, electric vehicles (EVs) are ushering us into the future. Just as gas-powered engines replaced horse-drawn carts a century ago, EVs are disrupting the industry and setting the standard for the next hundred years of auto innovation.\nIn short, EVs are taking over. EV sales in the U.S. rose 62% in the first half of this year, and now make up 5% of new car sales. While this may sound small, it actually marks a tipping point for EV adoption. The shift to EVs could also accelerate rapidly, as drivers are still feeling squeezed by higher gas prices. In fact, searches for \u201cbest gas mileage\u201d are growing globally by 90% year over year.1 And, according to industry analysts, about 45% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.\nThese numbers have helped automakers see the EV light. They\u2019re investing over $526 billion in an all-electric future, which includes building new assembly lines and parts, learning to produce and store batteries, and preparing for changing tax implications.\nBut is their marketing keeping pace too? As brands work to get EVs in the hands of consumers, many auto marketers are still relying on an outdated playbook. Here are three ways they can rethink stale strategies and make their EV marketing as electric as their vehicles.\nAn avalanche of EVs is coming, leading to a crowded marketplace. The 2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Car Wars report projects that by 2026, 60% of the new models launched will be electric or hybrid.2 And more models mean more choices for auto shoppers.\nIn addition to a crowded market, automakers will also have to contend with the fact that EV models do not have the same level of brand recognition that gas-powered vehicles do. Indeed, 1 in 4 consumer searches for EVs are unbranded.3\nThis means automakers need to build brand recognition for new vehicles now to be well positioned and top of mind when EV options increase for shoppers. One way to achieve this is through video ads that can differentiate a brand\u2019s EV from the competition by touting its unique selling points. In our studies, we found that 80% of new auto purchasers took an action after watching a video,4 such as searching online for more information, visiting a dealer website, scheduling a test drive, or creating custom specifications for a new vehicle online.\nTo see how high consumer interest in EVs is, you only need to look online, where searches for EVs are accelerating. People are also looking for more detailed information about EVs, which suggests they might be heading further into the consideration phase. For example, while searches for \u201celectric vehicle\u201d have grown 87% year over year globally,5 more detailed searches like \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d have also grown by 80%.6 And searches for \u201cbest electric cars 2022\u201d have grown in the U.S. by over 5,000% year over year.7\nThis gives brands the opportunity to meet people in search results and answer their most common questions and concerns. This in turn will help brands become a major part of customers\u2019 path to purchase, guiding them every step of the way. But which search subjects should brands focus on?\nAccording to Gearshift, the most researched topics by people interested in EVs are general explorations of EV or hybrid vehicles, vehicle charging information, maintenance, and environmental benefits.8 And notably, the top two concerns that prevent people from considering EVs are anxieties over vehicle charging or range and other technological issues.9\nPotential EV customers may be at an all-time high for consideration, but they\u2019re very unsure about making the final purchase. Most potential buyers are undecided on whether or not to buy an electric car, and most of them won\u2019t end up converting.10 In the end, just 33% of new U.S. car buyers who considered a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle bought one.11\nApproaching hesitant buyers with outdated marketing tactics and a one-size-fits-all message probably won\u2019t make much of a dent, especially since the EV market is evolving so rapidly. Brands must be able to zig as customers zag and deliver tailored messaging to varying customer segments with different needs and concerns.\nTo do this at scale, brands should use automation and machine learning to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time. The real-time data from automated campaigns can also help brands learn more about potential customers and easily tweak their messaging to increase its effectiveness. By using these modern marketing tools, brands can convince hesitant buyers to choose a vehicle of the future.\nAs consideration and sales of EVs rapidly increase, automakers can set themselves up for success by using video to differentiate their brand and EV models from the competition, appearing in EV search results to answer customer questions, and leveraging automation to deliver the right message to a wide range of consumers.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Whether it\u2019s pressing the reset button or discovering new cultures, travel can be a restorative and inspiring experience. But for many LGBTQ+ travelers, it comes with underlying stresses.\nBoth during the planning stage and on the trip itself, they can feel forced to hide their authentic selves. Traditional booking touchpoints, such as the research phase or checking in at the chosen accommodation \u2014 which should be part of the fun \u2014 become a source of anxiety.\nAmon Versteeg, senior director of business marketing at Booking.com, knows from personal experience what this is like. So he worked closely with his team to introduce the Travel Proud program, which helps to make travel a safer, more enjoyable experience for the LGBTQ+ community.\nWith hospitality defined as \u201cthe friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers,\u201d feeling welcome is an intrinsic part of the customer experience. And when it comes to creating inclusive hospitality, Booking.com\u2019s motto is \u201cyou can\u2019t truly experience the world if you only show up as half of yourself.\u201d\nThis underscores what prompted the birth of Travel Proud \u2014 \u200b\u200ba training and certification initiative for the hospitality industry to ensure the LGBTQ+ community can travel safely and experience the full joy of travel, no matter who they love or how they identify.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ community is not accustomed to being 100% themselves. Over time and over history, we\u2019ve learned to suppress a part of who we are,\u201d Versteeg explains.\nThis means that LGBTQ+ people tend to travel with what Versteeg describes as a \u201cdetective mindset,\u201d constantly searching for clues as to whether they will truly be welcome at their chosen destination, even if it is advertised as inclusive tourism.\nVersteeg\u2019s aha! moment came when he was planning a safari with friends, and they found an incredible ecotourism site. He checked an LGBTQ+ inclusive lodging directory, found the lodge there, and excitedly told his friends.\n\u201cMy friend didn\u2019t understand why this was important, so I explained I didn\u2019t want to get to the middle of the safari and find out there would be an issue with my husband and I. My friend then said we\u2019d just have to tell them we were brothers if that happened.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s not innate to everyone to think about this. It still grounds me.\u201d\nTo better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ travelers, Booking.com conducted a survey to gauge the community\u2019s lived experiences. It revealed that more than half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had a less than welcoming travel experience.\nThis includes situations that are not necessarily intentional but can make people feel unwelcome or stressed while on vacation. For example, 20% of those surveyed had staff assume they would need separate rooms or beds when checking in as a couple, while 1 in 5 have felt the need to change their behavior \u2014 and 16% to change their appearance \u2014 to avoid judgment or awkward interactions with accommodation staff or owners.\nVersteeg\u2019s team also identified keywords and feelings from each travel touchpoint, such as researching where to stay, the actual process of booking (for example, does the property booking page use gendered or binary terms only), the arrival at the property, and their experience during their stay.\nThe results were striking. \u201cA word that repeatedly came up throughout the journey, from research through to check-in at accommodation, was \u2018caution.\u2019 And it soon became clear that \u2018safe\u2019 means \u2018good.\u2019 And at the end of the journey the emotion is \u2018relief,\u2019\u201d says Versteeg.\n\u201cFor example, when someone in our trans community is checking into accommodation, and they provide identification with a gender different to how they\u2019re presenting: This is a huge moment,\u201d Versteeg explains. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for companies to really show what welcoming looks like. Whether it\u2019s avoiding gendered pronouns or knowing that it\u2019s OK to ask what your guest prefers. That can have a huge impact.\u201d\nTravel Proud seeks to address this issue. Property owners who host on Booking.com receive coaching from Hospitable Me, which specializes in diversity and inclusion training for the hospitality industry. This training guides property owners on how they can make their venue more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ travelers, and provides tools to grow awareness and understanding. In turn, they will be featured as an inclusive destination on the Booking.com site.\nAs well as the number of venues that signed up to the program (10,000 and counting), Versteeg notes that he was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of properties that are now listed through Travel Proud, from small one-off rural destinations to major venues. \u201cIn a short time, we already surpassed 10,000 properties achieving the Proud Certified standard in our key focus markets.\u201d\nTravel Proud is a big part of Booking.com\u2019s work to deliver more authentic experiences to travelers. For LGBTQ+ travelers specifically, Versteeg states the need to challenge the meaning of what good travel means. \u201cUltimately, a good experience should be more than a safe experience. When we hold a mirror up, we ask \u2018Have we done this for everyone?\u2019\u201d\nFor other companies wishing to make similar strides, Versteeg advises starting small: \u201cFocus on understanding what would make a difference in your organization, and then turn it into many small steps. See it as a continuous journey rather than a destination.\u201d"

        "output": "Marketers are under strain as the economy and privacy regulations continue to shift at a rapid pace. Eighty-nine percent of marketing decision-makers agree that leadership is raising the pressure on them to demonstrate ROI, according to research that Google recently commissioned with Kantar.1\nAs a result, finding effective ways to assess how well your advertising works, while remaining privacy-conscious, is more important than ever. In this environment, how can you be confident when making decisions that set up your business for growth?\nAI-powered solutions can strengthen confidence and deliver better outcomes, all in a privacy-safe way. But to get the most from these solutions, you need to lay the groundwork and get the essentials right. By building your first-party data strategy and setting up a privacy-first digital marketing foundation, you can unlock better measurement and effectively collaborate with AI to drive business results.\nTo deliver results today and drive sustainable growth tomorrow, focus on these four key areas.\nPrivacy and performance aren\u2019t at odds. AI-powered solutions enable you to balance the two and unlock advantages for your business. This is because the predictive and analytical capabilities of AI deliver improved ROI while filling the measurement gaps created with the phaseout of third-party cookies.\nThe first step is to implement a first-party data strategy. This requires thoughtfully communicating with your customers when gathering consent about how you do and don\u2019t use their data. Research suggests that a proactive approach to privacy can give marketers a significant leg up with consumers.\nIn a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 49% of respondents said a positive privacy experience with a second-choice brand would convince them to choose that brand over a preferred brand.2\nOnce you\u2019ve built a durable foundation of first-party data, you can unlock more accurate measurement and gain a clearer view of the customer journey. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.\nThe marketing team at Calendly, a scheduling automation company, understands that a privacy-first marketing strategy is only as strong as the technologies that support it. So they built a privacy-safe measurement infrastructure that allowed them to focus on their most profitable customers.\nThrough sitewide tagging, Calendly defined the type of user that would sign up for an account and push for larger team adoption. Next, it joined the brand\u2019s online and offline data to better understand the customer journey. Within 10 months, Calendly had a full-funnel view of its highest-value prospects and customers. Furthermore, this site-tagging implementation helped the marketing team convince leadership to invest in long-term data and measurement infrastructure. As Jessica Gilmartin, CMO of Calendly, shares, \u201cby connecting Google AI to our product and customer data, we\u2019ve been able to prove the ROI of our marketing investments to our executive team. It\u2019s completely changed the game for us.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve made gains in first-party data collection, AI-powered solutions like modeling, predictive targeting, and analytics can inform your measurement strategy \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have user-level data. This fusion of innovation and privacy will help you take your business to the next level while being responsible stewards of people\u2019s data.\nPrivacy-first data collection is only the first step. A natural follow-on opportunity is to use AI-powered insights to better understand what\u2019s working well. For example, the Insights page in Google Ads uses AI to help you predict rising search trends, understand performance changes, and uncover new audiences that may not conform to your typical customer profile. Insights like these give you an alternate view of your customers\u2019 characteristics and behaviors \u2014 including ad engagements \u2014 so you can connect with them in more meaningful ways.\nSearch agency Solutions 8 used Google AI to uncover surprising insights on behalf of a food industry client. Solutions 8 ran a Performance Max campaign for its client, a producer of shelf-stable food products marketed to a particular type of customer, namely \u201cdoomsday preppers.\u201d Thanks to the Insights page in Google Ads, the agency soon learned that audiences with an interest in boating and sailing significantly outperformed the client\u2019s traditional audience. With that knowledge, it created assets for this previously unrealized customer segment and started a new campaign for the sailing audience.\nBy combining first-party data with insights, marketers can take decisive actions that lead to improved ROI and business outcomes.\nGoogle AI can help you achieve more precise campaign performance by predicting future consumer behavior and constantly optimizing to your KPIs.\nFor example, German online retailer Baur turned to Google Analytics 4 predictive audiences for a recent Google Ads campaign. By targeting an audience of likely purchasers, it achieved sales growth of 56% and an increase in conversion rate of 87%. In fact, Baur calculated that 70% of these customers could only be reached using these predictive audiences in Google Ads.\nYou can also use audience and performance data to inform AI-based solutions that maximize results over time. Take Smart Bidding, which uses Google AI to optimize your bids in every auction and increase conversions based on your goals. Using Smart Bidding, the French automobile brand Citro\u00ebn saw a 16% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) by implementing a value-based bid strategy.\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. We encourage you to adopt an iterative mindset so you can operate as confidently as possible. A spirit of experimentation will validate that your measurement and our AI powered solutions are working in a world with fewer individual identifiers.\nFor instance, advertisers who use marketing mix models (MMM) should use experiments to calibrate those models. A single experiment may be sufficient to effectively modify your MMM. When Google commissioned Nielsen to use NCSolutions\u2019 sales-lift results to calibrate its mix models, the revenue and ROAS attributed to YouTube increased 84% on average.\nThe majority of that volume was previously attributed to base variables (brand distribution and pricing), thus reallocating that volume to YouTube improved marketing results overall.\nBy directly validating what\u2019s working, you\u2019ll be able to combine your own learnings with Google AI to enable more accurate measurement and deliver results for your business.\nWe\u2019re at a critical moment in our industry. Our goal at Google is to give you confidence that your first-party data foundation, audience modeling, and measurement setup are all working hard to deliver results for you. With AI-powered tools at your fingertips, you can rest assured that you\u2019re building the most effective and cost-efficient measurement strategies possible while respecting the privacy of your customers."

It's important to include the following facts in it. \n- LGBTQ inclusion in marketing and media is good for business\n- Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that supports LGBTQ rights\n- LGBTQ representation in advertising needs improvement\n- Inclusive marketing creates a more accepting society\n- Realistic and empathetic storylines are more important than celebrity endorsement in LGBTQ representation",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In preparation for the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Adrienne Hayes, Google\u2019s VP of marketing for global devices and services, spoke with Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD\u2019s president and CEO, about why LGBTQ inclusion in marketing and media is good for business. Hayes is also a GLAAD board member and serves as global executive sponsor of Google\u2019s LGBTQ employee resource group.\nIn recent years, companies have increasingly recognized the value that diverse, inclusive, and equitable marketing practices bring to their brands. For marketers, this has been deeply clarifying. Every creative choice we make has the power to shape how we see each other. Inherent in that responsibility is an incredible opportunity: to create work that positively and authentically reflects the world.\nWhile historically excluded from advertising, the LGBTQ community in the U.S. has seen positive movement toward greater inclusion and diversity in brand marketing and increasing acceptance by the general public. A report published last December by GLAAD \u2014 the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer media advocacy organization \u2014 and the Edelman Trust Institute found that Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding LGBTQ rights.\nAlong with this momentum, however, there have been plenty of setbacks. Marketers in the U.S. are likely familiar, for instance, with recent backlash experienced by one major retailer for displaying Pride Month merchandise, and the scrutiny experienced by a major brewing and beverage company after partnering with a transgender influencer. These mixed signals \u2014 rising consumer support on the one hand, push back on the other \u2014 can leave brands unsure of their own inclusive marketing plans.\nSo what does the data actually say about people\u2019s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and what should brands be doing \u2014 with confidence \u2014 to honor their inclusive marketing commitments?\nGLAAD recently released two studies that can be instructive. Its ninth annual Accelerating Acceptance study, which examines acceptance and attitudes toward LGBTQ Americans, showed that a record number of non-LGBTQ Americans support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. Support is quite literally at an all-time high. But an analysis of representation in advertising tells a different story.\nThis month, GLAAD\u2019s Advertising Visibility Index \u2014 an inaugural research report offering a data-backed reality check on LGBTQ representation in U.S. advertising, along with prescriptive guidance for brands \u2014 indicated that the LGBTQ community\u2019s size is not accurately reflected in ads and that current methods of inclusion are not always apparent to consumers. The takeaway is that there is room for improvement for the vast majority of brands.\nRecently, I sat down with Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO at GLAAD, to discuss the two studies and identify actions that marketers can take today to make their marketing more inclusive.\nSarah Kate Ellis: Our findings are really significant for marketers. For instance, we found that 3 out of 4 non-LGBTQ adults feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, which seems to validate that the backlash to inclusive ad campaigns really is coming from a small, though loud, number of activists. Inclusion is not only good for the bottom line, but when consumers are exposed to LGBTQ people and their lives in the media, that exposure has a profound impact on shifting culture and changing sentiments. Sixty percent of non-LGBTQ adults agree that seeing LGBTQ people in ads make them more comfortable with people who are different than themselves.1 So inclusion actually creates a more accepting society.\nEllis: Yes. We\u2019ve seen influencers and celebrities increasingly used in brand advertising, in general, and over 70% of inclusive ads we studied featured LGBTQ celebrities.2 But here\u2019s what is interesting: When it comes to LGBTQ representation, inclusion of an LGBTQ celebrity is the least important factor for consumers, LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ. What they\u2019re actually looking for are displays of empathy and humanity, followed by realistic storylines, like families sharing meals or couples holding hands.3 People want to see the everyday, human stuff. It\u2019s realistic stories over celebrity endorsement.\nEllis: While it\u2019s distressingly loud, it\u2019s actually far from the norm. Only 17% of consumers say seeing LGBTQ representation in brand advertising would make them feel more negatively about a brand. And only 16% of consumers say they would be less likely to purchase that brand\u2019s products or services.4 At a time when 1 in 5 Gen Zers in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, the calls for inclusion will continue to grow and be louder than the critics.\nSo negativity exists, but it\u2019s a really small portion of people who feel that way. Inclusive marketing is everywhere, and just because a few brands get called out by a loud minority, does not mean that inclusive marketing will end. While the headlines focused on a few brands that tried to appease critics by changing Pride campaigns, so many other brands stood their ground and that supposed backlash faded.\nEllis: Absolutely. We posed all of these questions about LGBTQ representation, and while we know it\u2019s become both more common in some circles, it\u2019s become more contentious. But what was unexpected was that a lot of people aren\u2019t even noticing LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly two-thirds of consumers believe LGBTQ representation is explicit enough to be noticed by most people, but less than 40% of consumers noticed the representation in LGBTQ inclusive Super Bowl ads.5 So even when it\u2019s happening, people aren\u2019t always aware of it.\nEllis: Well, for starters, this is bigger than marketing. Seventy percent of non-LGBTQ consumers want companies to show public support not just in advertising but in sponsorships and hiring as well.6\nBeyond that, I think the biggest takeaway for me is the idea that representation means more than existence, more than the old \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d model. Today, it\u2019s more about being an integral part of your community. We\u2019re your neighbors and your co-workers; we\u2019re in your congregation and in your family. We\u2019re part of the fabric of society, and marketers must show that. LGBTQ people have the same desires and needs as every other American. We buy cars and laundry detergent, and we worry about our kids and our bills just like everyone else. That\u2019s the story folks in the LGBTQ community want told, and it\u2019s the story that needs to be told.\nAt Google, we\u2019re always striving to increase representation, especially during big moments, but it\u2019s imperative this remains a focus year-round. These findings are a great reminder that our work is never done and that our approach to inclusive marketing can still be improved if we want to stay relevant now and in the future. For example, my team worked on Google Pixel\u2019s Super Bowl ad this year, which featured queer artist Doja Cat. GLAAD tested this ad as part of the Advertising Index, and a majority of consumers who viewed it didn\u2019t recognize any LGBTQ inclusion. It\u2019s on us, and fellow advertisers, to seize the opportunity to tell more realistic, human LGBTQ stories."

        "output": "We\u2019re in the middle of a third paradigm shift. The first shift was the arrival of the internet, with its revolution in information and services. The second was the explosion of mobile computing, driven by the adoption of smartphones. And today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to deliver transformations that are even more profound, for both consumers and businesses.\nKristen O\u2019Hara, VP of brand and agency solutions at Google, addresses a crowd of conference goers about the AI paradigm shift.\nAs with the internet and smartphones, the emergence of AI is a critical development for businesses. But how best to strategize? Naturally, it\u2019s important that we exercise caution in the face of uncertainty to mitigate potential risk. As with any powerful new tech, we must actively work to understand AI and its implications for our customers and marketing activities. Remember, we\u2019re not competing against AI, we\u2019re competing against businesses that are already using AI.\nThe good news: Chances are, you\u2019re already using AI. Here at Google, we\u2019ve been layering it into our products for years. From autocomplete in Search to captioning on YouTube to Translate\u2019s mastery of over 100 languages, our products have gotten steadily better as a direct result of this technology.\nEighty percent of marketers are already using at least one AI-powered Search ads product as a business multiplier right now.1 And tests have shown that advertisers who upgrade their exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns using a target cost per acquisition can see an average of 35% more conversions.2\nPerformance Max offers another useful example. With this product, advertisers bring their business objectives, first-party data, and some creative assets. Google AI will then optimize marketing campaigns across Search, YouTube, Discovery, Maps, and more, meeting customers wherever they are. Advertisers using Performance Max are seeing an 18% uplift in conversions, up 5% since last year, showing just how quickly Google\u2019s AI models are advancing.3\nPerformance Max is about to get even more powerful. We recently announced we\u2019re incorporating generative AI to make it even easier for advertisers to create custom assets and scale them in a few clicks. Just provide your website, and Google AI will learn about your brand, populating your campaign with text and other relevant assets. We\u2019ll even suggest new images generated just for you, helping you stand out to customers across a wide range of inventory and formats.\nWith the power of AI, we\u2019ll discover endless possibilities for creativity through direct collaboration and experimentation. Today, AI can help you write a form letter or optimize your media mix. Tomorrow, it may overhaul your creative workflows, freeing you up to solve entirely new creative and strategic challenges.\nFor example, AI is helping The New York Times organize 7 million photos from over 100 years of reporting. Working with Google Cloud, the Times has digitized its vast photo collection, which had been stored in hundreds of filing cabinets three stories below street level in a space called the \u201cmorgue.\u201d But digitally storing the pictures is only part of the story. To make the archive accessible and useful, the Times used AI to \u201cread\u201d the images, not only by scanning text in the images and notes written on the back but by recognizing objects and places in the photographs, preserving annotations, and making the archive searchable. Now Times journalists can use this resource to report stories rooted in deep historical context.\nGenerative AI is opening up even more possibilities, and we are rapidly moving to a world where the constraints on what you can create in digital spaces are limited only by your imagination.\nWhat will this mean for all of us as marketers? For one, the gap between coming up with a great idea and deploying that idea will shrink considerably. For example, the new Product Studio tool uses generative AI to help businesses of all sizes create a range of high-quality product imagery. Product Studio can create custom product scenes for seasonal or trending opportunities, remove distracting backgrounds, or even increase the resolution and sharpness of your product photos without having to go through expensive reshoots.\nThese are powerful technologies with consequences for individuals and organizations that are still not well understood. As we move boldly toward this future of creative possibility, we must take a responsible approach. We can\u2019t see around every corner, but we can anchor to principles, respond to challenges that arise, and partner with researchers, governments, and communities to ensure we get it right.\nI\u2019ve been asking myself and my team some tough questions as we navigate this third paradigm shift. Here are a few questions you can ask as your teams figure out how to harness the power of AI."

Commercial creative would not exist without the talent behind it, full stop. And just as marketers have been using AI-powered tools, creatives have been experimenting with AI in everything from ads that talk back to concept decks that sing.\nWith responsive search ads (RSA) and responsive display ads (RDA), we\u2019ve already seen the ability of AI to optimize thoughtfully crafted assets into the best-performing combinations of creative. We know that AI can scale asset production to serve the most relevant version of an ad across channels via Performance Max, App, and Video action campaigns. Now, to get a pulse on how interdisciplinary creative teams are already exploring AI, we asked agency leads across three regions how they use it. Here\u2019s what they said.\nDuring the 2019 holiday season, a team tasked with selling the Google Nest to Australian shoppers had a unique opportunity to let people test the product from the comfort of their own homes.\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the experience of Nest into the ad itself, so that was the moonshot then \u2014 essentially, quite a while back before generative AI was a thing,\u201d said Tingyan Han, senior data strategy director, APAC at EssenceMediacom. \u201cWe needed to demonstrate the many ways in which Nest makes moments at home better.\u201d\nTo do that, the team turned to a speech-to-text API co-authored by Google with the help of the Google Nest and Google Media Lab teams.\n\u201cThere were many considerations when working with a speech-to-text API, from the UX to ad inventory and measurement, all the way down to testing whether local accents were recognizable,\u201d said Han. The ad would pause within the first few frames to allow the user time to opt in to the experience. When users said, \u201cHey Google, show me gingerbread house recipes,\u201d it would do as told.\nThe activation led to an increase in consideration to purchase. Vincent Tay, creative director, APAC at EssenceMediacom, says that\u2019s because the interactivity served to demonstrate the benefits of the product itself.\n\u201cWhile the thought of integrating new and shiny technology into every facet of our campaign can be alluring, we must always remember to place the human truth at its core,\u201d said Tay, who partnered with a UX/UR designer alongside Han on the campaign.\nMore recently, Publicis-owned Leo Burnett Australia used AI to build a talking car; Leo Burnett Taiwan used another kind of AI to celebrate Lunar New Year with potato chip-inspired fortunes.\n\u201cWe have been using Google Colab regularly for early prototyping efforts involving up-and-coming AI algorithms,\u201d said Laurent Thevenet, head of creative tech at Publicis covering APAC and MEA. \u201cWe are also starting to use Bard, as we like the fact that it is connected to the internet and can retrieve real-time information.\u201d\nIn addition to sending regular updates on emerging tech to its 4,000 creatives across the region, Publicis is also mentoring talent internally, sending mentees back to their respective agencies and teams with new knowledge.\n\u201cMachines need operators and, for the creative industry, it means that creatives will partner with machines, directing them towards the desired output,\u201d said Thevenet. \u201cThese creatives have to be hybrid talents able to think critically while having the ability to operate and connect these emerging AI systems with one another.\u201d\n\u201cImagine a concept store on the moon. What does that look like?\u201d\nEd Yeoman, creative director at London-based branding and design agency Human After All, has observed his team bringing AI into the ideation stage to collaborate on design fiction for this type of \u201cwild-card idea.\u201d\n\u201cSome people use it to get verbal prompts around language and messaging, and some people use it to get visual prompts to help them kind of imagine something that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d including events and event spaces, he said.\nGabriel Cheung, Global Executive Creative Director, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, says AI-generated content can also challenge teams to push their thinking. \u201cBecause of the way AI works with existing information, we let AI-powered tools quickly generate the \u2018first thought\u2019 ideas. Our thinking is that if AI can generate the same idea, then we haven\u2019t done our job well enough to come up with something new,\u201d said Cheung.\nGoogle recently announced a new conversational experience in Google Ads and Search campaigns that can be used to enhance brainstorms, a use case Yeoman\u2019s team found helpful.\n\u201c[The prompting] part of the process \u2026 puts you in the role of the creative or strategic director,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cOftentimes, at that level, you\u2019re helping to frame challenges for people to inspire them to do certain things. It\u2019s the same with AI. You\u2019re hoping to frame this challenge in a way which gives you an optimal output.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s announcement of the forthcoming addition of Adobe Firefly to Bard represents a commitment to ethical image generation. Firefly is trained on a catalog of hundreds of millions of licensed images in Adobe Stock. As private technology companies develop responsible AI and call for regulation, creative agencies are writing their own ethical guidelines.\n\u201cWe felt that there was a little bit of a lack of people talking about what it meant for humans,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cAt the heart of our business are the principles of empathy and reason. We try and build those into everything.\u201d\nEvery year, global creative agency Jellyfish Group invites its own technologists to a companywide hackathon. The participants invited to this year\u2019s event in Paris received a new kind of challenge: design an AI-powered solution for improving the quality and performance of creative assets. The event brought 120 technologists across data, media, and creative together to address this critical business need.\n\u201cThe benefit is huge; it elevates everyone\u2019s knowledge and experience, and that carries throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Sam Yates, chief solutions officer of creative technology at Jellyfish.\n\u201cAI has developed so fast and there\u2019s so much opportunity, but it\u2019s also kind of a wild West scenario,\u201d said Di Wu, VP of data science at Jellyfish Group. \u201cPeople are just starting to think about regulation and what it means for us to adopt AI. We created a task force around it to basically say, AI is not just about ethics; it\u2019s literally a business problem for us. If we\u2019re not using AI the right way, it could lead to bias because of the training samples used [to train the hypothetical model].\u201d Agencies will soon have access to more tools to create variations on their own work, ensuring ownability.\nWorking within established partner networks is one way to ensure safety, added Yates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stifle innovation in any way, but we do have to think about some of the risk mitigations that go with exploring new technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking closely with Google, for example, is a great opportunity for us to explore a tech stack in a safe and responsible way.\u201d\nEven before the milestones of 2023, Google had partnered with Jellyfish to design a bespoke service powered by Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Vision and Video APIs. \u201cOptics\u201d could decode which elements of an ad performed best according to a brand\u2019s goals and best practices like the YouTube ABCDs. With advances in AI, such methodologies could eventually enable teams to distinguish emotional content across ads, or even the presence of humor, to shed light on which creative choices resonated most with their brands\u2019 audiences.\nOnce teams have finalized creative assets, they can get the most out of them using smart creative formats like RSAs and RDAs. Tools like Performance Max can help make sure the right ad reaches the right audience at the right time, optimized for their chosen channels and screens. Research shows that advertisers see 2X more conversions, on average, when adding an RDA to an ad group with a static display ad.\nFrom creative testing to storyboarding, AI-powered solutions have a pivotal role to play in the future of creative development. The role itself must be defined by the needs of real creative teams, and some of the most useful applications may be found unexpectedly. Through active exploration and experimentation with AI, we can discover more concrete ways of thinking about the guardrails we want to uphold and the benefits to creative professionals they unlock."

It's important to include the following facts in it. \n- Companies that succeed in digital transformation have leaders who can confidently navigate uncertainty and change course quickly.\n- Next-generation leaders proactively operate outside their comfort zones, think cross-functionally, and elevate the strategic role of the board of directors.\n- Digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset and have marketing leaders who are open to change.\n- Cross-functional collaboration and monitoring initiatives outside of marketing contribute to better performance and revenue growth.\n- Leadership support across the C-suite and the board of directors is critical for successful digital transformation.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In the final entry of our three-part series on digital transformation, Google\u2019s Courtney Rose shares how next-generation leaders deal with uncertainty. Part one focused on how organizational shifts help companies transform, and part two explored the role of a strong relationship between CMO and CFO.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent times, the only certainty companies have is uncertainty. This can be challenging for organizations who strive to be digital first, as rapid industry shifts can easily pull their focus away from continuous innovation.\nBut some companies have figured out digital success. When we recently teamed up with Kantar to study how these companies navigated dynamic markets while preparing for the future, we saw a common trait: All had leaders who could boldly face the unknown and confidently change course at a moment\u2019s notice. These leaders transformed the fabric of their organizations, cultivating open-minded, collaborative approaches that sparked innovation, and did it in the face of constant change.\nOur research underscored that this type of next-generation leadership is defined by three behaviors that other companies can implement. The first is proactively operating outside traditional comfort zones. The second involves thinking cross-functionally, and the third focuses on elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\nDuring our research, many next-generation leaders said that building a digitally savvy organization requires CxOs to work outside their comfort zones by thinking broadly about their role and the role of the C-suite, and by responding to change through teamwork and creative problem solving. Our study showed that 70% of executives from digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset, compared to 47% from digitally emerging companies.1\nThis collaborative mindset is key to leading effectively during uncertainty.2 Among the marketing executives we spoke to, 80% of those from digitally leading companies agreed that their organization\u2019s most senior marketer is open to change, compared to 64% of those from digitally emerging companies.3 And leaders who combine traditional and nontechnical skills, like adaptability and intellectual curiosity, are in a better position to develop a culture of collaboration and respond effectively to constant change, particularly when it comes to marketing initiatives.\nAs one CTO said, \u201cChange drives people nuts, but people who embrace it are the ones who can actually help us in the future.\u201d4\nAnother way next-generation leaders help their companies stay flexible during uncertain times is by developing a holistic understanding of their entire organization and encouraging cross-functional teamwork. Executives who told us that their marketing leaders proactively monitored company initiatives happening in areas outside of marketing were also 32% more likely to say their company performed much better than their competitors in revenue growth.5 When leaders think cross-functionally, they create the opportunity for marketing, finance, sales, and IT teams to understand how each group\u2019s operations impact the collective and how they can work together to drive growth and innovation.\nWe also learned that this cross-functional collaboration should extend to the leadership teams themselves. Among digitally leading companies, 70% of the CxOs we surveyed stated that support across the C-suite and the board of directors was critical to successful digital transformation. Just 46% of executives from digitally emerging companies acknowledged this level of leadership support.6\nWhen senior leaders are aligned, they can offer their separate teams a clear, unified strategic vision and shared objectives, which can serve as a North Star during volatile moments. They can also encourage greater cross-functional collaboration by removing hierarchy and helping employees further develop soft skills like communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.\nBeyond ensuring C-suite alignment and collaboration, company leaders can future-proof their organizations by building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors.\nThis starts by ensuring that the board consists of the right people. For example, 82% of marketers from digitally leading companies said their board consists of people who can play a contributing role in supporting digital transformation, while only 42% of marketers from digitally emerging companies made the same claim.7 On top of this, board members who are still active in their professions can provide valuable external perspectives, such as spotting pitfalls, challenging assumptions, and bringing fresh ideas to the table.\nNext, leadership must consider the board\u2019s role in the wider organization. CxOs should encourage the board to move away from simple business signoffs and toward engaging with the company\u2019s overarching strategy. In our study, 1 in 3 senior-level marketers said that the board should push leadership to think creatively and take meaningful risks.8 This can help ensure that the company remains focused on digital innovation during disruptive times.\nWhile business leaders can\u2019t control rapid changes in the market, they very much define how their organizations respond and whether they continue to innovate. Next-generation leaders have proven their resilience and flexibility by stepping out of their comfort zones, fostering companywide collaboration, and empowering boards of directors to take an active, valuable role in their companies\u2019 overarching operations and strategies.\nLearn more about how the next generation of leaders drive growth on the route to digital readiness."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret the media landscape has changed. This past year alone we\u2019ve seen a rise in short-form video and a breakout in AI-powered solutions. People are exposed to a wider variety of content and new ways to consume it, and one-size-fits-all campaigns are no longer enough.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners are blazing new trails by ditching the \u201cmatching luggage\u201d approach and accounting for people\u2019s unique needs. From tapping into YouTube trends to designing bespoke creative across formats, these advertisers expertly created unforgettable YouTube campaigns that resonated with audiences and drove results. Here are four lessons gleaned from the winners.\nLife insurance company MassMutual wanted to drive awareness around a bold topic: money. The brand recognized that conversations about finances are important but aren\u2019t always easy to have. It needed a creative way to grab attention and inspire people to tune into the topic. So it created a lighthearted campaign featuring diverse families having conversations about their financial futures amid unexpected events. The result was an intimate, fly-on-the-wall experience.\nMassMutual sought to make its ads unskippable by breaking the fourth wall, ingeniously utilizing the first six seconds to deliver different variations of the statement, \u201cThis is going to be extremely uncomfortable; you might want to skip this.\u201d This small-but-clever detail showed viewers that MassMutual was directly addressing them, creating a powerful connection.\nThe innovative strategy was wildly successful. In a head-to-head test, its 100% watch rate was 14 percentage points higher and costs per view (CPV) were 2X more cost efficient for creative featuring the made-for-YouTube 6-second add-on.\nSource: MassMutual Internal Data.\nLiv Lewis, EVP of EGAMI Group, praised MassMutual for their authenticity. \u201cNot only did they brilliantly embrace diversity of casting, they embraced diversity as it truly shows up in life.\u201d\nPopular blender brand BlendJet needed a campaign that could drive awareness with new customers and transform existing ones into enthusiastic brand advocates. Its strategy? Create compelling content and engage both audiences. BlendJet tapped into big YouTube trends that have stood the test of time. Assets included YouTube fan favorites such as cake or fakes, bewildering viewers with a blender disguised as a cake, and ASMR videos, soothing them with 10 hours of BlendJet assembly.\nBlendJet also mixed things up to appeal to the next generation of YouTube viewers, using the latest video trend: short form. The brand expertly integrated horizontal and vertical assets with long-form and short-form content to connect with audiences across various viewing preferences.\nReturn on advertising spend and scale allowed BlendJet to increase spend by 55% and helped drive a remarkable 66% revenue growth.\nAs Jonathan Daly, head of communications strategy at Droga5 raved, \u201cThis creative naturally utilizes the super power of YouTube as a social platform. It\u2019s designed to be highly addressable to the audience.\u201d\nOn a mission to rev up consideration, eBay Motors sought a platform that would inspire and excite audiences. That\u2019s why it raced toward YouTube, a go-to destination for inspiration. The brand teamed up with Google\u2019s Creative Works to identify trends and insights, landing on one key insight: People come to YouTube to go deep with the creators and content they love. With that in mind, eBay handed YouTube creators the keys and cocreated a masterfully produced five-part series that pitted modded cars against stock cars, with parts all purchased on eBay. Popular YouTube creator and race-car driver Collete Davis hosted each eight to 12 minute episode, featuring a special guest builder representing a subculture and product category.\nTo maximize viewership, eBay paired episode drops with paid YouTube advertising, and the results were remarkable. The brand grew its YouTube channel subscriber count from 700 to over 37,000 subscribers \u2014 606% above its goal \u2014 while generating more than 9 million views across episodes.\nSource: eBay Internal Data.\nDenise Truelove, global VP of brands at Mars Petcare, sang the team\u2019s praises. \u201cThis is a perfect example of a brand becoming entertainment.\u201d\nBeauty brand Dove also leaned into the power of long-form video to foster engagement. Over the years, Dove has fearlessly taken on the subject of real beauty to address timely issues. Recognizing how important parents\u2019 voices are in shaping children\u2019s self-esteem, the brand created nearly four-minute videos as part of its recent Dove Self-Esteem Project campaign. The videos featured face-mapping technology that put toxic advice into mothers\u2019 mouths, leaving viewers captivated.\nFor the initial push, Dove used YouTube Mastheads and in-feed video ads with a powerful thumbnail image to get people to click and watch the video. Additionally, it used video ad sequencing to prime viewers with a 15-second clip before serving the long-form version. The results spoke for themselves: 6.2 million lifted users associated Dove with raising awareness about the toxic advice girls are exposed to.\nAs Lex Beltrone, group creative director of FCB New York, put it, \u201cThis type of long-form video wouldn\u2019t feel right on any other platform but YouTube.\u201d\nBenjamin Moore, a premium paint manufacturer sold at local retailers around the world, faced a challenge. As businesses reopened and people ventured beyond their homes, home improvement took a back seat. Coupled with the economic headwinds, it was more important than ever for the company to support its local retailers. The brand took an innovative approach. It developed creative showcasing unique end cards for over 1,000 local retailers and paint colors, inspired by each region\u2019s stunning color palettes. Embracing the power of granular geotargeting, Benjamin Moore masterfully reached a small radius around a store\u2019s ZIP code in densely populated areas, while expanding reach in sparsely populated areas.\nIts colorful strategy paid off. Benjamin Moore achieved an average video completion rate of 55% across all regions, exceeding its 45% benchmark, and an impressive 30.4 million views, which was 215% over planned. With this captivating campaign, the brand flawlessly demonstrated that YouTube can help brands achieve a perfect balance of meticulous focus, expansive reach, and authentic user connection.\nSource: Benjamin Moore Internal Data.\nSimilarly, marketing automation platform Mailchimp embraced a full-funnel strategy to connect with small businesses that grapple with marketing challenges. Aiming to drive purchase intent, Mailchimp designed a whimsical campaign, featuring visuals like dancing rugs, to comically depict the confusion marketers often feel. Knowing that small business owners and decision-makers are at different stages of the funnel, it executed a highly tailored approach.\nAt the top of the funnel, it harnessed bumper ads and skippable ads, and tapped into audiences using custom affinity audience targeting to amplify brand reach. For the middle and bottom funnels, the brand shifted focus to driving engaged click volume and used Video action campaigns and audiences like custom intent. Lastly, it reached its most engaged viewers with a sign-up call to action. Moreover, Mailchimp embraced the changing landscape of how and where users watch its video content by harnessing the popularity of short-form video and updating vertical creative.\nThe highly personalized approach paid off, with a 4.2% increase in awareness and a remarkable 34% decrease in cost per paid sign-up year over year.\n\u201cThe ads helped not only empathize with the marketer\u2019s confusion but also gave them the tools and confidence to make tough marketing decisions\u201d marveled Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer and partner of Goodby Silverstein & Partners.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners showcased exceptional talent in tapping into customer needs and implementing innovative strategies to cater to diverse interests. By using the full breadth of YouTube\u2019s capabilities, these brands transformed the platform into a dynamic canvas to showcase their creativity, tell their stories, and authentically connect with their audiences."

        "input": "",
        "output": "AI is transforming marketing in profound and exciting ways. In my conversations with marketers, it\u2019s inspiring to hear how they\u2019re using AI to drive new customer connections, build high-quality creative, and make confident decisions grounded in predictive data.\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that AI can\u2019t drive marketing success by itself. AI is capable of multiplying business results and growth, but only when it\u2019s paired with human expertise. Marketers will continue to be essential in setting clear objectives \u2014 aligned to broader business goals \u2014 so that marketing impact can be accurately measured and decisions about where to invest can be more informed.\nWith that being said, the speed at which technology is evolving can leave even the most innovative marketers wondering whether their current strategies are enough to unlock AI\u2019s full potential and accelerate business growth. That\u2019s where we can help.\nFor several years at Google, we\u2019ve been building products that apply cutting-edge AI to help marketers navigate the rapidly changing landscape. In that time, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with thousands of brands and agencies to accelerate their business growth with AI, and through that experience we\u2019ve learned what works.\nHere are three key areas to prioritize for success with AI.\nA critical, often neglected aspect of AI is the causal relationship between the inputs you give to AI and the business outcomes it can generate. The fact is, AI learns from the data and experience that people provide. The higher quality the inputs, the better the results.\nMarketers who strengthen their measurement strategy and improve the quality of their audience and conversion data, for instance, can guide Google AI to better maximize their ROI. This is particularly true when consented first-party data is an input. Because it comes from direct customer relationships, the data is more durable and uniquely relevant to your business.\nRetailer H&M is a powerful example of how first-party data can be used to improve campaign performance. Last year, H&M\u2019s global head of paid media, Kristoffer Ullenius, and its global digital media analyst, Katarina Ahlner, shared more about their strategy. \u201cWhere we previously didn\u2019t optimize our paid Search campaigns towards acquiring new customers, we now started actively thinking about ways to reach them.\u201d This meant refocusing the strategy to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t buy unless they were influenced by marketing.\nH&M began by deepening its understanding of the value of each customer segment, using a customer life-cycle model rooted in first-party data. This helped the team identify frequent buyers and put less emphasis on reaching them with paid Search, to focus instead on acquiring incremental new customers. Only when customers became less active would they use Search ads to reengage shoppers.\nThis approach, coupled with a shift to a customer-focused Target ROAS bidding strategy, helped H&M grow online revenue from paid Search by more than 70% year over year. According to Ullenius and Ahlner, \u201cAs the whole business moves towards being more customer-centric, it\u2019s been rewarding to see how much impact we can make by focusing our paid efforts on value.\u201d\nWith high-quality data in place, the next key focus area is using AI-powered campaigns to optimize your performance in real time. Every day, we\u2019re seeing that marketers who leverage Google AI can deliver more conversions and get more value out of their campaigns.\nPerformance Max, for example, is a goal-based campaign type that helps advertisers find untapped and incremental opportunities. Advertisers share their campaign goals and creative assets, and our technology automatically produces and runs a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google\u2019s channels.\nSamsung recently put Performance Max to the test across multiple markets to find untapped consumer demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\nAccording to Sandeep Bajpai, director and head of direct-to-consumer marketing at Samsung India, \u201cThe results were phenomenal. With AI-powered campaigns, we doubled our revenue without affecting our return on advertising spend too much.\u201d\nThe final area to prioritize is as critical as data and technology but wholly reliant on people. To get the most out of AI, you need a shared mindset that\u2019s anchored in experimentation and agility.\nIn a recent report created by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, in association with Google, industry leaders shared guidance on how to maximize AI as a business multiplier. Many of them emphasized the importance of a test, learn, and scale mindset, where your team can fail fast but learn quickly which new approaches can unlock profitable growth.\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, explained, \u201cTo protect profitability, experimentation should happen within a controlled environment. Cross-functional teams will need to nurture a test-and-learn culture where leaders can quickly adjust the plan when results don\u2019t come in as expected, or double down on what works.\u201d\nWhile AI solutions may be perceived as disruptive, they can be approached in a gradual manner. Embracing a culture of experimentation is a critical factor for organizations trying to reap the full benefits of AI.\nFor example, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica spent considerable time thoroughly testing AI-powered campaigns and analyzing the business impact of changes to bidding automation, campaign structure, and feed management. According to global performance marketing director Andrea Orlunghi, \u201cTesting new solutions allowed us to create a shared definition of success that spanned across departments.\u201d And its success was tangible. \u201cIn the past two years, combining a wide range of Google AI solutions contributed to nearly a 50% growth in the global online business of EssilorLuxottica.\u201d\nFostering agility by balancing early plans with an ability to pivot is equally important, especially in the context of planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels.\nFor many companies, however, quickly shifting budgets to the biggest opportunities isn\u2019t easy. This is typically due to traditional silos in media channels that carried over to budgets and organizational structures. Unfortunately, these silos can be kryptonite for AI, limiting its ability to optimize and maximize performance.\nBy evolving your multichannel approach to be nimble enough to respond to consumer demands, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to capture incremental performance opportunities as they emerge. This process can be further bolstered by directly aligning marketing KPIs with business goals and partnering with your executive leadership to accurately quantify marketing\u2019s contribution based on key financial metrics. Research shows the results are worth it: Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.1\nIn sharing these AI essentials, it\u2019s my hope that you feel equipped to act today in ways that strengthen your marketing and accelerate business growth for years to come. If you\u2019re interested in learning how you can use Google AI solutions to supercharge your strategy, review the full checklist below and share it with your team."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Kendall Kazor is a member of Google\u2019s People Development School for Googlers team, which produces Resilience at Google, a podcast examining the science behind resilience and high performance. This excerpted interview features a conversation from Season 2.\nCreativity can be hard to define, but it\u2019s an essential skill in today\u2019s workforce. Creativity helps us solve existing challenges and envision new opportunities, and it is considered an X-factor by many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies.\nAs the pace of work and connectivity steadily increases, how do we create the space we need to come up with our best ideas? Can we be creative and productive at the same time? And how do we keep the creative spark lit, even when we start to feel drained? These are questions we hear often from Googlers, but they are not questions unique to Google.\nIn April of this year, we launched a podcast series to help people better understand resilience, which we define as the ability to respond to and recover from stress. Every episode pairs neuroscientists and psychologists with mental performance coaches who discuss the science behind resilience, along with effective ways to react to change and other daily challenges.\nIn the first episode of the podcast\u2019s second season, we focus on creativity \u2014 specifically, how to recharge ourselves and maximize creativity during periods of high stress and transition. For this conversation, we were joined by digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush and associate professor of sport and performance psychology at Nottingham Trent University Dr. Mustafa Sarkar.\nWe\u2019re all striving to be our best, and often we equate that with being productive. Rahaf, you wrote a book called \u201cHustle and Float,\u201d which is a helpful concept for thinking about productivity. Can you explain it?\nRahaf Harfoush: \u201cHustle and float\u201d is a phrase borrowed from white-water rafting. It\u2019s the idea that, to have a good rafting trip, you need a mix of hustle and float. There\u2019s a period when you have to exert yourself to make the raft go where you want it to go, to move forward. But there are also periods when you have to lift your oar and let the river do the work. Too much of one or the other will ruin your trip. Too much hustle, and you\u2019ll get exhausted and make mistakes that can be dangerous. Too much float, and it\u2019s boring; you don\u2019t get where you want to go and are at the mercy of the river. The idea is that, in order to successfully navigate, we have to balance between when we do the work and when the river does the work. And that\u2019s easily applied to productivity culture: We\u2019re so accustomed to hustling, we don\u2019t remember how to float.\nCreativity helps solve big problems, which makes it a fundamental leadership capability we all need. Mustafa, when we consider team resilience, creativity is such a key part of navigating challenges and uncertainty. You study high-performance teams. What specifically have you noticed about managers and other leaders?\nMustafa Sarkar: Team learning is vital to resilience; teams that are on the same wavelength are better able to respond as a collective to difficult situations. Teams need time and space to perform in this way, and leaders are critical to shaping an environment and intentionally creating time and space for creativity. Effective leaders also have influence over the ideas that are generated.\nPrioritizing time and space for creativity is so important. But there\u2019s a misconception that prioritizing creativity comes at the expense of productivity. How do we overcome that to embrace the idea that focused work and detachment give teams a competitive advantage?\nHarfoush: Since we define productivity as continuous visual output, we tend to obsess over visible work performance. For most of us, the visible work \u2014 the presentation to the client, the final research report \u2014 is just a fraction of our process, maybe 25%. The remaining 75% is unseen, and so we think it\u2019s invisible to performance. And, from a resiliency perspective, we are accustomed to optimizing and getting drained as if it\u2019s an end state to be celebrated, rather than treating our creative energy as a sustainable resource to be renewed and replenished strategically.\nSarkar: There\u2019s an analogy about a cellphone battery: As humans, we often wait until we are at 5% energy to recharge, but we would never wait until our phone is at 5% battery power to charge it. We\u2019d probably start charging it at 30%. Why do we do it with our phones but not ourselves?\nWe know our best ideas and our best performance moments come after the rest, and we see that proven by professional athletes all the time. Why is it so hard to slow down?\nHarfoush: There\u2019s a myth that says your success is solely dependent on your ability to work hard. And that anytime you\u2019re not actively demonstrating that you\u2019re working hard, you are signaling that you\u2019re not deserving of your own success. In reality, we know that hard work can move the needle, yes, but there are so many other factors.\nSarkar: An important thing to consider when we talk about work devotion is identity and what fills your life outside of work. If you have multiple identities \u2014 if you\u2019re a father, a mother, a footballer, an exerciser, a cook, whatever it may be \u2014 you\u2019ll consider those aspects of your life very important. But if your identity is solely tied to work, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll see yourself and your success.\nOften there is a badge of honor around how hard we all work, especially among high performers. How can companies go about shifting that belief system?\nSarkar: Resilience is cultivated by design, not by default. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically, and that\u2019s why focusing on the work environment is so important. As a leader or manager, you must focus on proactively creating an environment where it is safe for people to speak up when they see things that aren\u2019t healthy, and creating opportunities where you can hold up your hand and acknowledge your own mistakes.\nHarfoush: To build on that, it\u2019s important to consider questions that contribute to environment: What does success look like here? What behaviors do we hold up as aspirational? How do we measure performance? How do we define performance?\nI also encourage clients to start with small experiments. Make hypotheses about what you think you can prove through experimentation. Maybe you\u2019ll see better strategic thinking and fewer mistakes when people aren\u2019t sleep deprived and overstressed. Get the data and build on what you learn.\nOne of the top questions we get from people managers at Google has been: What can I do now to increase my team\u2019s resilience and productivity down the road? What\u2019s your advice?\nSarkar: Resilience boils down to cultivating relationships, particularly because of remote and hybrid work. There\u2019s a saying that \u201cstrangers can\u2019t team,\u201d and many of us are in a situation now where we don\u2019t know our teammates. Working to cultivate relationships and shared values is more critical than ever.\nHarfoush: Productivity is a reflection of a system, and it can be anything that you want. So if you want to increase your team\u2019s productivity, then it\u2019s critical to specify what that means. Is it increased time for deep work? More periods of intense collaboration? Eliminating distractions through prioritization?\nAnother thing for managers to think about is anti-fragility \u2014 not just helping your team be productive and resilient through disruption, but using the disruption to grow and be better. As strategic thinkers, we have to be adaptive and responsive, and challenge assumptions and evolve. All of those things require a different relationship to change. So as leaders, we must really get to know ourselves, our creativity, our energy, and what drains and replenishes us.\nDownload and listen to the full conversation on Google Podcasts or wherever you find your favorite shows."

Use these three tips to help you drive more sales with up to 3 billion people as they scroll through content on YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.\nYour images will be the first thing people notice when they come across your Discovery ads, so be sure to use the highest possible image resolution. Also, highlight your product or service to help people instantly understand what you\u2019re showcasing.\nTo more accurately illustrate how your products or services work, upload the highest resolution images possible (1200x628, 960x1200, and 1200x1200 pixels) and consider using images that show people using your products. Based on an internal analysis with Creative Works (formerly Unskippable Labs), images with a person drive 4% more clicks compared to images without a person.1\nUse overlay text sparingly. It can have a varied appearance on different devices and create a less compelling experience for people scrolling through their feeds. Our internal analysis with Creative Works shows that, on average, images without overlay text drive 9% more clicks.2\nAudiences, messaging, and creative assets that have performed well for your other media campaigns, such as video or social, can help you unlock performance with highly engaged audiences on Discovery ads. Be sure to include at least 10 converting Search campaign keywords in each of your custom intent audiences, and make the most of Google\u2019s automated audience features: Advertisers who use audience expansion with Discovery ads see 52% more conversions at a comparable cost per acquisition to their originally selected audience.3\nIn summer 2020, U.K. fashion brand Ted Baker used its social ads creative assets to build Discovery campaigns, connecting with previous website visitors and shoppers interested in clothing. As a result, Ted Baker saw a revenue lift of 70% and a 62% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) in under one year.\nAutomated campaign types need the right budget, a variety of great assets, and enough time to analyze the performance of your ads to determine which settings for your creative assets and bids work the best across your audiences. Your campaign optimizes your settings for peak performance over time.\nIf you\u2019re running Discovery ads for the first time, give your campaign time and space to learn what works by choosing an average daily budget at least 10 times the value of your target cost-per-action bid. Then wait for at least 40 conversions before making any changes.

        "input": "",
        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in the entertainment industry. Here, actor, author, and advocate Selma Blair explains why it\u2019s time for media to shift toward a world where everyone sees themselves represented and how to build belonging into media. A version of this article first appeared in Variety on July 19, 2022.\nStorytelling is powerful. Stories can ultimately shape your identity and how the world sees you.\nThroughout my life, my story has been told by other people: Manic depressive. Drunk. Mean.\nIn my memoir, \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I wrote about never feeling a sense of belonging. Throughout my life, I often felt disconnected from my body, out of control, as if I didn\u2019t belong in my own skin. I learned not to show or talk about pain because I didn\u2019t want it to define me, nor did I understand what my pain meant.\nIn 2018, I was finally able to tell other people how I identified myself: disabled. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and learned it had been attacking my central nervous system for years. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have anyone in the entertainment industry to look up to who had a disability or was open about their diagnosis, and I didn\u2019t see my experiences reflected in the stories being told on screen. Even though it was difficult learning I had MS, at least it had a name now. After being confused about who I was for so long, I finally understood myself \u2014 and I belonged to a community. In a way, it was also freeing.\nI started thinking more about the power of storytelling and why representation in media matters. If I had seen and heard from people who were like me, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone. Perhaps if I\u2019d had more diverse representation to look up to, I would have learned about my own diagnosis earlier on (I was shocked when I learned one of my idols, Joan Didion, also had MS).\nNow I truly feel comfortable embracing all parts of my identity \u2014 including my disability \u2014 and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s time we shift the story about how disabled people are represented. It\u2019s one of the reasons I started looking at the work Google has been doing to build inclusive practices into its marketing. United by shared values and a vision that authentically represents disabled people\u2019s stories, I want to help the rest of the creative industry use Google\u2019s learnings to build a world where everyone belongs.\nSince my diagnosis, I\u2019ve become close friends with Andra\u00e9a LaVant, a leading voice in the disability community and founder of LaVant Consulting, a disability-focused strategy and communications firm. I\u2019ve learned so much from her and her team and the work they\u2019ve been doing with brands, including how they\u2019ve supported Google to bring disability into its advertising and internal programs. All In, Google\u2019s inclusive marketing toolkit, draws on years of internal insights and collaborations to build intentionality into every step of its advertising process.\nIn partnership with LaVant Consulting and many other leading organizations, Google launched an accessible marketing playbook on All In as a practical guide for every marketing effort. This is such a powerful resource for so many reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s informed by the lived experiences of people with disabilities.\nThis approach deeply reflects a core principle in the disability community: Nothing about us without us. Who better to build a strong sense of belonging for disabled people than we who belong to the community?\nWhile I want to use my voice to support the disability community, I also strongly believe that I can\u2019t be the only spokesperson for everyone with a disability. Our experience is ours alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pull in as many people and experts from the community as possible.\nIn addition to LaVant Consulting, Google has worked with Disability:IN, GLAAD, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Ad Council, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (The 4A\u2019s), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, Cannes Lions, and many other expert organizations across the world to create All In and contribute to Google\u2019s continued inclusivity practice.\nThis level of collaboration creates space for the more than 1 billion disabled people around the world. It also acknowledges that each person has a unique background and set of circumstances. My disability is just one identity, and my experience is just that \u2014 one person\u2019s experience. Disability will touch everyone at some point in their life, whether permanent, temporary, visible, invisible, or age related. Partnering with diverse experts and perspectives also emphasizes the opportunity to consider people\u2019s whole identities, including gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education.\nThis matters beyond advertising, All In\u2019s original focus. There is a movement happening, and the entertainment industry needs to be a part of this cultural shift. Everyone benefits from accessibility, because it opens up work to a wider, more diverse audience.\nI\u2019ve already learned a lot through the accessible marketing playbook on All In; it would have been a helpful resource while I was writing \u201cMean Baby.\u201d For example, throughout my memoir I described people as \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair.\u201d The playbook suggests that a more inclusive description would be \u201cwheelchair user\u201d or \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d This is a great example of something that may seem small, yet is so impactful.\nAll In also taught me that disability inclusion is a mindset, not a box to check. It requires a sustained commitment, a constantly evolving work process, and ongoing learning for each and every one of us. This is important for us to remember if we\u2019re to make meaningful change.\nIn \u201cMean Baby,\u201d I write that the thing about limitations is that they aren\u2019t really about you at all. They\u2019re often constructed by others, and when they\u2019re removed, you realize that all this time you\u2019ve been capable of soaring.\nThe entertainment industry has the ability to do so much to help tear down these limitations. Committing to accessibility breaks down barriers, enabling creatives to be better in their work. It\u2019s time for the wider creative media industry to commit to inclusion and elevate the significance of this growing cultural shift. Everyone deserves to have their story represented authentically and feel a sense of belonging.\nWhether you\u2019re a producer, creator, marketer, or actor, All In is for you. These are steps anybody can take today. Commit to helping change the creative industry to be more inclusive by learning how on Google.com/All-In."

        "output": "Data analytics should be top of mind for every advertiser, but building a successful and effective analytics team can be challenging. Here, Google marketing and analytics leaders break down key principles businesses can use to realize the potential of a tech-savvy analytics team.\nDigital transformation \u2014 the process of using digital technologies to modernize business performance, agility, and sustainability \u2014 is widely seen by marketing leaders as the key to future-proofing organizations. To get the most out of digital innovations, companies must be able to pinpoint where to focus their efforts and to understand what strategies are working best. That\u2019s why a strong data analytics team that can communicate real-time data insights to the C-suite is crucial to driving meaningful digital transformation.\nCompanies that build a successful analytics team are more likely to see revenue, profit, and market share gains.1 Yet, according to the Digital Maturity Benchmark, only 9% of businesses use insights and technology effectively to create better consumer experiences. Why?\nThrough Google\u2019s own experience building world-leading analytics teams and our work with hundreds of other companies, we\u2019ve identified three core principles that can help businesses overcome challenges and build successful analytics strategies and teams.\nWhen it comes to investing in your organization\u2019s analytics, prioritize people over tools. Investing in people leads to a flexible analytics capability, which can adapt to a changing business environment without locking the organization into an unwieldy system of software and tools.\nWhile many Fortune 500 companies have made great investments in analytics tools, most still struggle to make meaningful data-driven business decisions. That\u2019s largely because this investment strategy makes the mistake of thinking that tools, rather than people, are the solution to building better analytics. The tools themselves can only go so far without the right people behind them.\nThese misplaced efforts led us to develop a 10/90 rule for web analytics success: Invest 10% of the analytics budget in tools and the remaining 90% in people. For example, if you\u2019re paying a web analytics vendor $25,000 for an annual contract, you should be prepared to invest a further $225,000 in people to get meaningful value from that data.\nTo be sure, software systems and vendor professional services are important components of a successful analytics team. But it\u2019s the analysts, not the tools, who transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the 10/90 rule, CxOs can draw on the winning combination of computer processing power and human judgment to inform marketing activities and business decisions, and understand consumer behaviors.\nAnalytics teams thrive in dynamic environments that reward curiosity, encourage innovation, and set high expectations. Building and reinforcing this type of culture can help put organizations on a path to earning impactful returns from analytics investments.\nAn active analytics culture thrives when CxOs reward curiosity over perfection. Encourage analysts to challenge convention and ask questions as a method to improve quality and reduce risks. This thinking goes hand in hand with a test-and-learn mentality, where pushing boundaries through proactive experimentation helps identify what works, and optimize accordingly.\nIt\u2019s also important to create a culture where failure and success are celebrated equally. Giving airtime to what went wrong allows the team to more effectively learn from their mistakes and see that perfection is an unhealthy pipe dream. This encourages an environment that holds analysts accountable for delivering quality processes and results, further helping to mitigate risk and improve marketing programs.\nHigh-performing analytics capabilities cannot and will not happen without the full commitment of an organization\u2019s senior leadership. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that leaders collaborate with analysts to understand the data behind decision-making.\nC-level leaders can create an analytics-friendly environment by knowing when to collect data, presenting business challenges to analyst teams, and consistently seeking to quantify goals and objectives. Leading by example, data-savvy CxOs can show leaders that it\u2019s better to go to analyst teams with problems to solve rather than requests for specific deliverables, championing these non-analysts to be experts in their distinct businesses \u2014 rather than analytics.\nMaintaining a winning analytics capability requires endorsement up and down an organization. This sets the tone for a company that values understanding measurement solutions as well as the problem-solving expertise analysts can deliver across the organization.\nNow\u2019s the time for businesses to establish a data-centric culture that positions them to win with analytics today and in the future. Companies that do it are more effective and efficient, earn impactful insights from their data, and can attract and retain top-tier analytics talent.\nSo start laying the foundation for your company\u2019s in-house data analytics infrastructure immediately. Audit your organization\u2019s current analytics capabilities to identify gaps and opportunities in your marketing strategy. Then, identify what leadership you need to close gaps in capability and design by successfully implementing the principles we\u2019ve shared.\nBuild your organization\u2019s own high-performing analytics team, and join the future-ready businesses that are taking their marketing further."

        "input": "",
        "output": "While some brands are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their messaging and marketing campaigns, an essential component of inclusivity may be missing: accessibility.\nIt's especially important to cater to people who are typically underserved in the digital world. For example, people who are blind or have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, are neurodivergent, or those who have motor conditions. These individuals often face barriers when an experience is not properly designed. Online journeys are often convoluted experiences for people, and brands need to ensure their apps and websites don\u2019t add further complications.\nBuilding accessible user experiences will soon become a regulatory requirement too. This year, European Union member states are adopting the European Accessibility Act into their laws. The expectation is that all products and online services will need to be accessible once the requirements come into force in 2025.\nSo where do you start on your accessibility journey? We\u2019ve spoken with four brands about how they think about and build for accessibility and disability inclusiveness. Here\u2019s what we learned.\nAdvertising is powerful because it connects with people through storytelling. But what if someone misses key elements of that story? This question led consumer goods manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G) to incorporate audio description, a voice-over describing what\u2019s happening, into their video ads.\n\u201cThe introduction of audio description stems from my personal experiences,\u201d explains Sam Latif, company accessibility leader at P&G, who is blind. \u201cI was in a meeting when an ad for Flash played, but all I could hear was the song \u2018Flash\u2019 by Queen. What I didn\u2019t realize was that a dog was singing that song, because, without audio description, I couldn\u2019t understand the humor of the ad.\u201d\nThe P&G team worked with The Royal National Institute of Blind People to learn how audio description is done and integrated it into its ads.\nP&G didn\u2019t stop there. In 2021, they launched the first audio-described Super Bowl ad. It also ran its first adaptive audio description trial in the U.K. This means applying audio description to TV ads that don\u2019t have enough natural gaps in the dialogue to provide a description. And, most recently, it added audio description to its YouTube channel.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have all the answers but are proud of the progress we have made,\u201d says Latif. \u201cExperiences like this have led to change, with audio description opening up our advertising to millions more people around the world.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway conducts research directly with people with disabilities, from customers who are blind or have low vision to those with nonvisible disabilities, such as dyslexia. Its goal: understand people\u2019s first-hand experiences when using the delivery app and build inclusive products.\n\u201cObserving people with access needs using our app has been a strong facilitator of change and awareness across the organization,\u201d says Naoil Sbai, a global research team lead at the company. \u201cIt helped us realize the impact that simple changes could make. And it made us rethink how people interact with our app.\u201d\nThis motivated the research team to identify optimization opportunities with the Android Accessibility Scanner. The automated tool flagged key recommendations, such as increasing the size of touch targets \u2014 the tappable space around a navigation button.\nOnce this issue was known, it took them just a day to make the touch targets bigger. Something seemingly small \u2014 and a quick fix \u2014 can make a world of difference to customers, especially those with limited dexterity. And, as a bonus, this makes it easier for anyone to order their food quickly while on-the-go.\nL'Or\u00e9al had accessibility front of mind when building its new website. \u201cThe first step toward accessibility is to understand the different types of disabilities and how they affect millions of people,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Cunche, the beauty company\u2019s digital project director.\nWhen it learned how customers with low vision and cognitive conditions use the website, it set out to raise awareness within the company. It adopted the industry-standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to improve the website experience. And it partnered with an agency that specializes in this topic to help implement the guidelines across the business.\nWith the basic foundations in place, the product team took it one step further by layering on additional features. For example, they now offer accessibility controls in the website navigation menu, so people can select settings based on their needs.\nThe first feature is high-contrast mode. This removes background images and allows people to view the site in a strong white-on-black contrast, making it easier to read and focus on the content.\nThe team also added an option to deactivate animations to reveal a static header image on the page instead. This can help people with vestibular disorders, for whom motion can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea.\n\u201cAfter several tests and user surveys, all results are very positive and encourage us to go further,\u201d continues Cunche. \u201cWith knowledge comes responsibility, and only then can we create a better digital experience \u2014 for everyone.\u201d\nBooking.com is a large and complex organization, with many teams working on different elements of the digital travel company\u2019s app. As different people, code, and designs feed into the app, some features don\u2019t always behave as they should.\nFor example, during testing, the accessibility team found that some navigational tabs were not working correctly with screen readers \u2014 software that reads visual information from the screen out loud. In some instances, the screen reader would read out the wrong tab. Someone wanting to navigate to the \u201cCar Rentals\u201d section could be accidentally directed to the \u201cTaxis\u201d page.\nThe accessibility team partnered with the design systems team to update the components \u2014 the building blocks within an app \u2014 so that accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, were built in from the start.\n\u201cIf we use components that are accessible by default, we can innovate and be agile, without having to focus on getting it right all the time, every time,\u201d explains Booking.com Engineering Manager and Accessibility Lead Parham Doustdar. Doustdar has been blind since birth and is an expert at navigating websites and apps with screen readers, so this accessibility issue was very familiar to him.\nHowever, this work didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, because some legacy components did not reflect the changes. The team partnered with another group in their organization to update the technology so the accessibility changes could be adopted throughout the entire app. Now, as pages are built and updated, everyone working on the app automatically uses components that have accessibility built in.\n\u201cIt doesn't matter how accessible your components are if no one is using them,\u201d continues Doustdar. \u201cYou have to harness existing initiatives, where possible, and partner with other teams to increase adoption.\u201d\nHere are some final tips to help you improve accessibility.\nAnd, above all, know that people\u2019s varied needs continue to change, so you\u2019re never finished creating more accessible user experiences.

        "output": "Ben Jones is the global director of Google's Creative Works, a newly formed team with the mission of helping brands drive better business results with more effective creative.\nNo matter what tools or technology you have at your disposal, good creative is the last unfair advantage of ads that work. It\u2019s only natural that marketing and creative teams develop their own \u201crules\u201d about what makes for effective creative on YouTube ads. We often find that those rules could benefit from a reframe. The truth is, successful brands on YouTube use creative strategies and mindsets that bust assumptions. Here are a few misperceptions we've encountered and some suggestions for how you might reframe them into best practices for YouTube ad creative.\nYou should absolutely take risks on YouTube. But that doesn\u2019t mean shooting in the dark to find what works. There are some basic principles to making effective YouTube ads, and these principles can inform which risks are worth taking. The ABCDs of effective creative on YouTube are based on years of research on tens of thousands of ads from all over the world to uncover which specific creative elements contribute to the biggest impact on YouTube.\nAds that follow the ABCDs as a guide have been shown to yield 30% lift in short-term sales likelihood and 17% lift in long-term brand contribution.1 There\u2019s still plenty of room to build creatively on those foundations, but keeping them in mind will better equip you to take those risks and make more effective creative choices.\nWhile there are certainly creative principles you can start with, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach to execution. Looking at the wide spectrum of effective YouTube ads across marketing objectives around the world, we\u2019ve found that focusing on what your ad says and how it makes people feel is more important than the way your ad looks.\nEffective YouTube ads can be many things, like an episodic docu-series, an undercover investigation, a user-narrated product review, or an interview with the CEO. It can be a music video partnership with a YouTube creator that becomes the No. 1 most-watched video in the world in its first 24 hours, leading to a 100% increase in year-over-year sales. It can even be an anime series starring the product as the hero, which sells out immediately, beats the team\u2019s KPIs, and boosts year-over-year product sales by more than 100%.\nYouTube is a breeding ground for creativity, and advertisers have as much of an opportunity to participate in that as anyone else on the platform. Effective ads give viewers a taste of your brand, product, or service \u2014 and that leaves a lot of room for creativity.\nSometimes ads that are meant to drive action get a bad rap. There\u2019s concern that lower-funnel ads cheapen the story or sell the brand short. But we\u2019ve seen brands get really creative with calls to action. It just requires thinking about the ad as the start of the viewer\u2019s next action, allowing the work to extend beyond that one impression. This is especially important on YouTube where 63% of viewers in the markets we\u2019ve studied say they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on the platform.2\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, AR, AU, BR, CA, CL, CO, FR, IT IN, JP, MX, PE, KR, ES, U.K., U.S., Why Video study, n=32075, A18-64 gen pop video users, March 2020\u2013Aug. 2020.\nA creative way to customize lower-funnel ads is to align with the viewer\u2019s passion points and make a more directed offer. Or you could employ a bit of reverse psychology like McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia did, when the team told viewers not to search for a product, knowing that would spark curiosity and encourage them to do just that.\nGucci U.K. got creative with ad sequencing to hone in on viewers most interested in its products as part of its holiday season campaign. Partnering with filmmaker Harmony Korine, the team produced a colorful, nostalgia-tinged video ad. With ad sequencing, they first raised awareness by featuring a campaign teaser video that led to the full director's cut on YouTube. Then, to increase consideration, Gucci showed a 6-second bumper ad series to viewers who showed interest in the teaser. Finally, the brand served product-focused ads to those viewers using TrueView for action and TrueView for shopping ads that connected them directly with the link to purchase. The campaign itself was viewed 5.4 million times globally with a 58% view completion rate, and it drove 44.5K clicks to Gucci\u2019s website.\nThere\u2019s a difference between having an experimental approach to creating video ads and conducting a one-off test. The former is a mindset that reaps deep learnings and keeps you from relying on long-held assumptions. The latter is a thing you do every once in a while, and works best for campaign-specific learnings.\nAn experimental mindset doesn\u2019t have to slow you down or cost you more, and it will pay off in the long term. Think of every campaign your brand puts out there as an experiment. See what you learn, which new questions emerge, and what needs to be optimized. Advertisers who successfully used Video Experiments saw 60% higher ad recall from the better performing creative.3\nSource: Google Data, Global, Successful Video Experiments were those with a significant difference in Brand Lift between experiment arms, 2019\u20132020.\nStart by changing one variable (big or small), like simple edits to the pace, the framing of your opening shot, or a variety of copy tweaks. Even the smallest changes can make a big impact. The more you experiment, the more you will understand not only what levers to pull creatively for your brand, but deeper insights about your audience.\nAspiration, a digital banking alternative focused on social good, has taken an experimental mindset when it comes to video creative. The team consistently tests through the entire production process. They run ads with variants of headlines, calls to action, and even landing pages to fully optimize their creative for success. By running different versions and looking at Brand Lift and Search lift results, they\u2019re able to determine the more effective creative to put their weight behind. Thanks to these optimizations and experiments, Aspiration was able to drive a 25% lift in relative brand awareness, over 16,000 email leads, and more than 3,400 new users.\nCreating assets tailored for each platform usually requires more lift than most brands and creative teams can spare. What we\u2019ve found is that when you start with a digital audience in mind, by grabbing attention immediately; building for mobile with tighter framing, large-type text, and color contrast for visibility on smaller screens; and with sound on, your ads will perform better everywhere, including on TV.\nThen for YouTube in particular, layer on some of its specific capabilities like personalizing your video ads at scale, like the Greek pizza chain Pizza Fan, or transforming a TV spot into a multipart video ad using ad sequencing, like LinkedIn U.K.\nIn its first ever brand-led campaign, LinkedIn U.K. had a beautiful 60-second TV spot. The team devised a test. They would run the TV spot on YouTube to see how it performed, and they would also run tailored-for-YouTube assets: four separate short-form videos that featured a large on-screen logo, with sound on, and sequenced together to serve to viewers over time. Hands down, the YouTube-tailored assets performed better. \u201cWe saw increased consideration by 20%, ad recall up 178%, and a campaign that was 2.3X more cost efficient in driving brand lift,\u201d said Katriona O\u2019Leary, the brand\u2019s group manager for paid media.\nGreat brands around the world are constantly pushing to rethink long-held assumptions about what works on YouTube. Follow the foundational principles of effective creative, think creatively, build for digital, and take advantage of the capabilities YouTube offers \u2014 all with an experimental mindset \u2014 and you\u2019ll be well on your way to making effective video ad creative.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio. Create with Google curates the creative insight, inspiration, and tools you need to make effective creative work \u2014 all in one place."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Dorothea Wiesmann Rothuizen and Wojtek Skut are engineers at Google, where they work on continually improving AI and large language models. They are a part of the team implementing new capabilities into Google Ads features, such as broad match.\nThere\u2019s been a wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, largely due to immense improvements in the underlying technology. Large language models (LLMs), for example, now enable a deeper understanding of language, which has led to conversations with AI that are much more natural and intuitive.\nThis same technology has supercharged broad match, a Google Ads setting that helps brands reach more people with their ads and reduces manual keyword work.\nWhile broad match has existed since the dawn of Google Ads, its early version wasn\u2019t perfect and began losing momentum about 15 years ago. Back then, it could have matched a search query, such as \u201ctreating a pet at home,\u201d to an irrelevant keyword, like \u201ctreats for pets.\u201d At the same time, \u201ctreating a pet at home\u201d would not have matched to the related \u201cwithout a vet,\u201d since the two phrases don\u2019t contain any of the same words. But, thanks to new advances in AI and continuous updates, broad match has evolved and can now better interpret nuance and context.\nIn fact, today\u2019s broad match understands people\u2019s search queries on a deeper level and can identify keyword search intent. This makes it one of the most effective solutions for search advertising.\nBelieve it or not, when broad match first launched, Google\u2019s engineering team would manually write out the synonyms for a keyword and cast a really wide net. For example, an ad keyword including \u201ccheap\u201d could match with searches for \u201cinexpensive\u201d and \u201cshoestring.\u201d While \u201cshoestring\u201d can be a different way of saying \u201cbudget,\u201d a user could alternatively use this word to search for shoelaces.\nThanks to new AI capabilities, LLMs can now better understand a user\u2019s search intent. We train them with billions of pieces of text so they can learn all the different variations and meanings of a word or phrase, and what sequences make sense. Once that fundamental foundation is in place, we will assign the AI a specific task, like matching ads to search queries.\nWhile the language technology can understand the potential demand that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s most effective when combined with Smart Bidding. This automated bidding strategy factors in a wide range of signals and surrounding data points in a privacy-safe way \u2014 such as search history, interests, and past purchases \u2014 to build a predictive model that helps advertisers identify the audiences most likely to convert.\nHere are three of the most significant improvements we\u2019ve made to broad match.\nIn the early days of broad match, the technology would connect the dots between keywords in a search query and an ad, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the order of the words in the query into account.\nFor instance, someone looking for a flight from London to Paris could have been shown an ad for a flight from Paris to London. To prevent this from happening, Google\u2019s search specialists would\u2019ve recommended a different keyword strategy to those advertisers. But today, broad match knows that going from A to B isn\u2019t the same as going from B to A. This improvement has also been applied to other areas where a search query only works one way.\nHere\u2019s an example. A user might be looking for a place to \u201cexchange euros to pounds\u201d or searching for a \u201cusb to usbc cable,\u201d and seeing an ad in which these words are in reverse order would not be relevant to them. Fortunately, the latest version of broad match now understands their search intent.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve often been asked: \u201cWhat happens when two ads for the same advertiser match to the same search query?\u201d Previously, broad match would have looked at an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank to help determine which ad to show, but which may not always have been the best choice.\nTo improve relevance \u2014 for advertisers and users \u2014 today\u2019s broad match considers supporting information, such as other keywords in the ad group and even the ad\u2019s landing page. And, thanks to the increased capabilities of the LLM that powers broad match, it better understands the meaning of a search query and its variations to improve relevance there too.\nMultilingual search is a third area that has seen a lot of development. Broad match now recognizes that some people might switch between languages when looking for something online, and it uses that information to serve the right ads.\nThe expat community is a common use case. For example, Turkish people living in the Netherlands or British people residing in Spain may be searching in their first language but looking for local-language results for the country they live in.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that running your campaign in one language means that you\u2019ll get traffic for other languages, since campaign success still relies on language settings and localized creative. But, in countries where many people are bilingual, it\u2019s helpful to know that broad match can match relevant, local traffic to an ad, even when the search is made in another language.\nBroad match may not be quite as old as \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d but it\u2019s been around for a long time. And, just like in the iconic 1985 movie, it shows us that sometimes looking at something from the past helps you understand its value in the present.\nThat said, while AI-powered language upgrades have made broad match far more effective for search advertising, it will continue to need a smart marketer in the driver\u2019s seat. Savvy marketers will check performance, select the right bidding strategy, and monitor new queries identified by broad match to bring in new customers. After all, you might discover new insights about your audience throughout the campaign.\nAI learns from you, and you learn from AI. Broad match\u2019s success depends on the team that uses it, just like the time-traveling car from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d needed the input and creativity from its creator, Doc Brown, to drive into the past \u2014 and the future.Tune into the Google Marketing Platform Partner Podcast episode \u201cTalking AI: How a deeper language understanding is transforming broad match\u201d to hear more about the ways large language models are supercharging broad match.

        "input": "",
        "output": "In today\u2019s business environment, planning ahead simply isn\u2019t enough. Marketers need to balance early planning with an ability to pivot. Especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty when budgets are under pressure, marketing and finance teams must work together even more closely to effectively deploy resources and maximize ROI.\nAn ingrained benefit of digital marketing has always been the ability to quickly change media plans and constantly optimize. More than ever, marketers have to lean into an agile mindset to shift budgets to the biggest opportunities. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy task.\nIn my past CMO roles at Calvin Klein Inc. and L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA, I remember how often industry media buying platforms were distinctly siloed by channel: search, online video, display, social, and more. These silos carried over to our budget and organizational structures, creating friction and inefficiency whenever we tried to optimize performance across many marketing channels.\nBut as technology and solutions like AI and machine learning have rapidly improved, so have opportunities to show up for customers in more connected and consistent ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a multiplying force for businesses. You can more precisely scale your marketing presence across channels, stay on top of consumer needs and trends, and achieve new levels of agility within your marketing.\nThese opportunities are empowering marketers to rethink their old approaches to multichannel digital campaigns to improve ROI. To better understand this shift, Google partnered with Kantar to survey over 2,400 global marketers and explore the importance of agility in planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels. From this study, we\u2019ve identified three core areas that require a careful balancing act to unlock greater agility and developed guiding principles for success.\nWhile initial budget planning is considered fundamental, marketers should also leave room for flexibility. In our study, marketers are considered behaviorally budget agile if they adjust budgets across digital channels on a weekly or more frequent basis. Based on this metric, nearly a quarter of the marketers surveyed are considered budget agile.1\nBudget agile does not, however, mean unprepared. Thirty-one percent of budget-agile marketers engage in formal marketing planning to align on strategy and digital-media budget allocations every month versus 18% of non-agile marketers.2\nBeing budget agile can also lead to better business outcomes. Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 And 48% of budget-agile marketers state that their marketing performance exceeded internal expectations and marketing KPIs, compared to 33% of marketers who are not budget agile.4\nThis finding did surprise us: Many of the marketers surveyed considered themselves more budget agile than they actually are based on their budgeting behaviors. On average, 60% of marketers who say they are \u201cextremely agile\u201d only make budget adjustments across digital channels monthly or less frequently.5\nWhile this gap between perception and actual behavior happens at all levels of an organization, C-level executives are 2X more likely than individual contributors to perceive their business as extremely budget agile.6\nThe disconnect between perceived and actual budget agility reveals that there\u2019s room for improvement across organizations. For me personally, empowering my teams to work with greater agility means I need to step back and allow them to make faster decisions. But this isn\u2019t the case for many businesses. Indeed, the budget approval process is quite lengthy for 54% of non-agile marketers, where changes to digital budgets of 20% or more take a month or longer for approval.7 And even agile marketers must deal with time-consuming approvals. For 59% of budget-agile marketers, changes to digital budget of 20% or more take a week or longer for approval.8\nMarketers also face heavy oversight and scrutiny over budget changes and reallocations. Fifty-two percent of marketers say that executive or C-level individuals have a heavy influence on budget adjustments after the initial planning period.9\nFortunately, our research shows that companies don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes to become more budget agile. Even brands and agencies that invest in dedicated channel expertise and specialist teams can still achieve quick wins to drive better collaboration and results.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to break down organizational silos. Fifty-eight percent of marketers have created more cross-channel team touchpoints, such as meetings, training, and information sharing to improve collaboration.10 And, compared to their non-agile peers, budget-agile marketers are twice as likely to call their marketing across channels \u201cvery tightly integrated.\u201d11\nThey\u2019re also leaning into their agency partnerships to stay on the cutting edge. Agencies can help encourage an agile mindset when it comes to budgeting and breaking down organizational silos.\nForty-two percent of budget-agile marketers say their agency partners greatly influence adjustments they make after initial budget planning, compared to only 31% of non-agile marketers.12\nNext, more teams are setting shared goals that allow them to take a results-first rather than a channel-first approach. This starts with implementing consistent measurement and success metrics that help marketers align on a common language, even when they work on different channels. In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed have instituted shared metrics and KPIs across channels to improve collaboration.13\nMarketers are also relying on Google AI to maximize budget agility across channels in real time. Budget-agile marketers are 29% more likely than non-agile marketers to use cross-channel automation.14\nOne example of this is demonstrated by the global streaming service Discovery+, which adopted Performance Max to improve how the brand optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. Regina Sommese, group vice president of paid media and global subscriber acquisitions at Discovery+, says, \u201cBeing budget fluid has always been critical for us, but the process has historically been manual. Performance Max allowed us to move away from managing siloed campaigns to one holistic optimization approach.\u201d\nAs global brands like Discovery+ have found, driving reliable results and creating a culture of experimentation don\u2019t have to be at odds. In fast-changing environments, marketers who can strike the right balance between investing in proven strategies and funding experiments that unlock new opportunities will deliver long-term growth. In fact, 31% of budget-agile marketers say it\u2019s \u201cvery easy\u201d to get additional budget to start new tests that weren\u2019t included in the initial media budget, compared to just 9% of non-agile marketers.15\nIn times of uncertainty, it can also be a natural instinct to become more conservative and pull back on marketing budgets. Only 17% of budget-agile marketers and 6% of non-agile marketers have channels with uncapped or unlimited budgets that make it easy to increase budgets for new opportunities.16\nInside Google\u2019s own marketing team, we\u2019re taking the exact opposite approach. We\u2019ve partnered with our finance teams to prove the incremental value of marketing by aligning marketing goals with real business outcomes, like profitability and customer lifetime value. We also reforecast our global budgets regularly to ensure that we can request more funds if we have room to scale successful tests against finance-approved ROI thresholds. This gives us greater freedom to avoid artificial \u201ccaps\u201d on digital media budgets that can limit our ability to improve results.\nAgile marketers help their teams move faster, pivot to take advantage of new performance opportunities, and ultimately drive more business growth. By finding the right balance across budget agility, cross-channel team collaboration, and experimentation, marketers can invest their resources more effectively to maximize ROI."

        "output": "The disability community continues to be underrepresented and undervalued in advertising. Here, KR Liu, Google\u2019s head of brand accessibility, shares her personal story and why accessible marketing is critical for every brand.\nI am female, queer, and disabled. For much of my life, these parts of my identity were rarely, if ever, authentically represented in media and advertising. This made me feel different, unvalued, and alone. As a result, I spent more than a decade hiding who I was in my personal life and at work.\nThen, a few years ago, I began to recognize that each part of my identity was essential and that no one part could exist without the other. It was the first time I felt as though people cared about all of me, rather than only my disability. That feeling was transformative.\nSadly, many others can relate to my experience of not feeling fully seen and represented in society, or in brand advertising. Great ads should reflect everyone, including the 1 billion people worldwide who identify as disabled and control 8 trillion dollars in spending. They should also acknowledge intersectionality, because like me, every disabled person has many dimensions to their identity that make them, them.\nSource: The World Bank, Global, April 2022.\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a day job that focuses on improving the accessibility of Google\u2019s marketing for our billions of users. While accessibility has always been core to our company\u2019s mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 being truly accessible is a journey, and we haven\u2019t always gotten it right. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to improve, and we are hoping to help other brands improve too.\nA year ago, we shared Google.com/All-In, an inclusive marketing toolkit for brands and agencies. Today, I\u2019m excited to share that All In now includes an all-new playbook on accessible marketing, which we developed in partnership with LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN, and has been endorsed by the American Association of Ad Agencies, Ad Council, Cannes Lions, and many other leading organizations.\nThe playbook has meaningfully guided our marketing this past year, and is the result of yearslong research and collaboration across many accessibility topics \u2014 from web experience to authentic depictions of people with disabilities. We\u2019re sharing it publicly with the hope it will improve the representation of disabled people in the media and help create work that is fully accessible. And, here, I\u2019m sharing three core principles from the playbook, with hope that it will inspire you to visit All In to learn more.\nDisabled people are their own experts, which is why it\u2019s so important to bring in their voices from the start. Often this involves dedicating the resources required to do accessible marketing right, such as training and support for internal teams.\nFor many companies, this may also involve leaning on a specialized third party for guidance. At Google, we sought out partnerships with several experts in disability inclusion, including LaVant Consulting and Disability:IN. Partnerships like these allow you show allyship and engage directly with the disabled community, which helps to expand the ideas that fuel your work.\nFor marketing to feel truly inclusive and accessible, brands must think about people with disabilities holistically, and consider the full spectrum of markers that comprise identity. Beyond disability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, and education level are just a few of the additional ways that people may identify themselves.\nFailing to recognize and reflect intersectionality in your messages runs the risk of reducing disabled people\u2019s multidimensional identities into oversimplified stories that can perpetuate stereotypes, rather than uplifting them. An excellent rule of thumb is to always opt for nuanced narratives, preferably ones that come directly from the people who are part of the narrative.\nOne example of this is our campaign, \u201cA CODA Story,\u201d which shares the multigenerational personal experience of Tony Lee, an Asian American Googler and a child of deaf adults (CODA). The film portrays Lee and his family as they bridge gaps in distance and communication during the pandemic by using Google\u2019s assistive technologies.\nBest practices for disability inclusion and accessibility marketing change over time as technology evolves and culture shifts. It\u2019s an ever-evolving journey that depends heavily on the needs of people with disabilities. Like other forms of inclusion, accessibility should be a constant commitment that\u2019s embedded into every aspect of your brand campaigns \u2014 from conception to execution, and beyond.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on accessible marketing, but we recognize that there\u2019s plenty of work ahead. Achieving our accessibility goals is a continual process, and we are perpetually learning from it.\nOne thing we\u2019ve proved over and over again is that accessibility and disability inclusive marketing are good for all people, and the benefits don\u2019t stop there. When everyone can fully access and engage with your products, content, and experiences, it\u2019s good for business. Brands that prioritize this concept as a human and business imperative will find that it opens up their work to a more diverse audience. Committing to accessibility in marketing breaks down barriers and enables brands to be better in their work, which is better for all users.\nTogether, we can drive a cultural shift that represents and celebrates people with disabilities as their whole selves. A world where everyone can see themselves is one where everyone has what they need to thrive."

        "output": "No\u00ebl Paasch, creative director at Google\u2019s Creative Works, leads brand and agency partnerships to determine best practices in advertising on YouTube. Here, she shares results from over two years of research to better understand the effectiveness of food, beverage, and restaurant video ads.\nShould your opening shot feature a satisfied customer enjoying your product mid-bite? Should it set the scene, steadily leading up to the product reveal?\nWhen it comes to creative decisions for video ads, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish pure aesthetics from what drives results. Without hard data, it\u2019s impossible to understand the psychology behind viewers\u2019 responses.\nOur ABCDs for creative effectiveness are data-informed, tested guidelines that can be applied universally to any video ad. In fact, Nielsen found that food, beverage, and restaurant ads that closely followed the ABCDs saw, on average, 31% higher sales lift.1 Supported by third-party research, our team recently conducted additional analyses to uncover more actionable creative insights around food ads. Here\u2019s what they found.\nThe experience of food is so much more than just its taste. A chocolate chip cookie is just as much its salty-sweet, fresh-from-the-oven smell, iconic craggy texture, and gooey chocolate melting on your fingers as it is its flavor. Our analysis shows that you can engage both sight and sound to make up for the lack of other sensory details.\nTake Magnum Ruby\u2019s ad, for example. When the protagonist takes a big bite of the chocolate-coated ice cream, the sound effect of the chocolate layer shattering evokes the experience of biting into a Magnum ice cream. Together, sight and sound are more compelling than either sense would be alone, summoning the memory of smell and taste.\nIt goes without saying that texture plays a big role in the characterization of any food. Would fresh pizza be as appealing without its gooey cheese or soft, bready crust?\nResearch shows that the majority of viewers watch ads on their mobile devices, so conveying the full visual through close-up shots of the product is extra important. Clear, crisp visuals help to communicate the product benefit quickly. This is generally good advice for any vertical on YouTube, but especially for food, beverage, and restaurant brands.\nC\u00f4te d'Or used this technique to great effect in their holiday ad. In each shot of the product, the chocolate takes up the full screen. The sheen of its smooth exterior and the grooves of the nut filling are so vivid, the viewer may as well have the product in front of them.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much one ad can show of the product itself. With limited time, shorter-form ads are perfect for focusing solely on the product, but studies show that long-form ads are more effective when they incorporate a human story. Introducing a human element adds context and makes it easier for the viewer to relate.\nIHop\u2019s \u201cAll You Can Eat Pancakes\u201d campaign included both a short-form and long-form video ad. The 6-second ad featured a single shot of the food itself, while the 15-second ad took advantage of those extra seconds by featuring three different people. No character is shown eating; we don\u2019t even get to see their faces. Yet the actors lend a human touch to the ad. Despite the age-old advice that every food ad needs a bite-and-smile moment, our analysis showed that a range of scenarios performed equally well, from ads that put chewing front-and-center to those in which no one actually ate.\nTry experimenting with varied ad lengths and creative executions to see what performs best with your brand and audiences.\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales lift, the memorability of your brand is as important as the food itself. And when it comes to brand expression, you should pull out all the stops.\nOur research shows that relying on a logo endcard might not be doing the most work for you. To make a lasting impression, think about seamlessly incorporating it throughout the ad, complemented by audio mentions, large type supers, and distinctive brand assets like mascots, brand colors, and mnemonics.\nThis Coca-Cola Vanilla ad does a great job of both subtly and not-so-subtly integrating the brand into all 20 seconds of video. The more your brand appears in the ad spot, the more likely viewers are to remember it.\nLastly, remember that the average viewer\u2019s brain can only retain so much information from any given ad. So when it comes to copy, our data supports using clear, accessible language.\nFor example, try describing the benefit rather than the ingredient. BelVita\u2019s breakfast biscuits are \u201cloaded with energy,\u201d while Special K\u2019s cereal is \u201cfeeding strength to power your moves.\u201d Special K takes the technique a step further by showing how the product helps active people, such as dancers, in their day-to-day lives.\nArmed with these five insights, your team can measurably increase creative effectiveness, making your products and your bottom line even more appetizing. Still, the best way to determine which creative practices support your goals, from awareness to conversion, is to experiment with your own ads and test them yourself."

        "output": "Today, people are spending more time online, and there\u2019s a growing challenge to hold their attention when they land on your site. When you do have their attention, it\u2019s even harder to capture their lead information. Landing pages aren\u2019t always the most popular sign-up forms, but they have the potential to accelerate your lead-generation efforts through effective design, copy, and prospect-acquisition strategy.\nWell-optimized website landing pages should convert prospects into leads. Think of it this way: Your website is like a storefront. A good landing page is a storefront window that welcomes customers by eliminating confusion and improving discoverability. Ultimately, it should convert prospective customers into solid leads.\nAt HubSpot, I\u2019ve worked with many brands over the years to optimize landing pages that deliver results. Here are four principles we use to increase lead generation.\nTo encourage the highest-quality results, landing pages should easily and quickly communicate the value of an offer \u2014 whether it\u2019s a guide, a set of templates, or a virtual event like a webinar. Be clear and avoid jargon. A well-built landing page should tell the audience what they should give in exchange for the content, how it will help solve their problem, and what exactly they\u2019ll get in return. The first impression that your customers will have of your company will come from your landing page, so it\u2019s important to think about your typical customers\u2019 fears and pain points. Be transparent by providing clear, comprehensive information up front \u2014 especially when it comes to factors such as additional fees, which may turn prospects away.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is worth a million. Adding compelling imagery and videos to landing pages helps grab attention and can help improve conversion rates. According to a HubSpot study on landing pages, 30% of top landing pages feature video content. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that imagery should be relevant and enhance the call to action (CTA), instead of driving added confusion.\nThe goal of a landing page is to have prospects hand over the desired information in exchange for the content or offer. Navigation of the page should be kept to a minimum and coupled with a clearly presented CTA to help customers quickly see the value in the page\u2019s offer and products. An action like \u201cDownload\u201d, \u201cSign up\u201d, or an otherwise relevant CTA at the top, middle, and bottom of the landing page can ratchet up more conversions because audiences don\u2019t have to go searching for the next step. Consider a personalized CTA, or smart CTA, which can convert 202% better than default versions.\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s marketing benchmarks report, companies see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. Successful landing page strategies have different pages to target specific audiences depending on where they clicked through from, and they keep each audience\u2019s motivators in mind through the entire page design. Improving relevance for your landing pages with different audiences can also lead to improved ad positioning \u2014 the better the experience your pages provide, the more likely your ads will show up in a higher position. One way to optimize your landing-page audience strategy is with Google Ads campaigns from Google and HubSpot. You can see how your leads perform by measuring key actions in the lead-to-sale journey, importing your offline conversions to understand the full value of the lead, and then using Customer Match to create personalized, meaningful landing page messages for different segments of those leads. Take the example of CallTrackingMetrics. The company synced its offline conversions to identify its most valuable leads and drove a 101% increase in marketing qualified leads.\nTo learn more about how you can help your small business succeed online, check out the new Google for Small Business digital essentials guide and the HubSpot and Google guide to Google Ads."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The marketing industry is entering a new golden age of opportunities, spurred by an unlikely catalyst: third-party cookies.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, industry leaders are making great strides to develop their \u201ccreative intelligence\u201d to reach and engage customers. Creative intelligence can be understood as the ability to customize creative without using third-party data, and then deliver these ads using the latest technologies to reach the right audiences, with the right messages, at the right times. The creative feel relevant and engaging, without the need for any personal data.\nAs we prepare for this new era in a so-called \u201ccookie-less world,\u201d here are three steps organizations can take now to build a privacy-safe creative strategy.\nMarketers must shift away from personalized ads toward a new, future-proof approach. The industry is on the cusp of a \u201ccontextual ads\u201d renaissance; these are ads that can be customized based on easily accessible information \u2014 like the date, time, weather, and even traffic conditions. This information is referred to as \u201ccontextual\u201d data, and it\u2019s been around for years but is often overlooked. These data points can play a huge role in helping marketers craft creative that is relevant and unobtrusive.\nContextual signals available to marketers\nBelgian windshield repair company Carglass recently used this privacy-forward approach to deliver customized video ads that drove impact. The firm delivered ads by using a combination of real-time data \u2014 including the weather and the streaming program a person was watching \u2014 along with first-party data about car ownership status. Contextual data about the user\u2019s country and language preference were also added into the mix. With all these data points, the company was able to serve individual viewers automated ads that were customized for the situation.\nFor example, a French speaker in Brussels watching a funny sitcom who had previously inquired about minor damage to their rear window would be served an upbeat advertisement in French, featuring rear windshield replacement and details about the Carglass service centers closest to them.\nThe ads led to an 89% drop in view-through conversion costs and drove bookings at a low cost per acquisition.\nAs third-party cookies are phased out, marketers can adapt to this new creative context by drawing from a base of contextual signals, then adding in first-party data to segment audiences. Marketing teams can then go a step further by introducing statistical models to refine the clustering of audiences and predict future behavior. This allows teams to more effectively deliver relevant ads to the right audiences.\nCreative is sometimes a neglected area of marketing strategy, considered secondary to media buying and ad tech. However, Forrester research shows that shifting marketing budget from technology to creative resources can improve return on investment by up to 18%.\nTo tap into this growth potential, marketers will require both creative investment along with automation. Automated solutions can shuffle up creative assets to deliver highly relevant ads to potential customers, while saving teams precious time and energy.\nEuropean beauty retailer Douglas recently demonstrated how creative and automation can work together to deliver effective, customized ads. The company set up a campaign to reach website visitors who had provided their first-party data, and also included a wider audience of like-minded people by harnessing Google\u2019s Affinity Audiences. From there, Douglas used contextual signals to deliver ads to online pages their audiences were viewing, but they featured ads only on pages that included specific keywords.\nThe beauty of this campaign was that the company delivered these ads with automated, customized creative. People who were considered \u201chigh-potential\u201d and more likely to invest in premium products \u2014 based on first-party data and the pages they visited \u2014 were shown relevant ads for high-end beauty brands and products. Douglas aimed to improve the average order value of these loyal customers. Other audience members were shown ads aligned with their interests in either makeup, perfume, or skin care, and the featured products had lower prices. The creative assets and products were automatically swapped around to make the ads feel deeply relevant to customers.\nExample of makeup ad (left) and premium ad (right) from Douglas\nTwo animated ads for beauty products from Douglas cycle through images of a white woman modeling the nail polish, moisturizer, bronzer, blush, and anti-aging products featured.\nCreative workflows need updating in this new era. Teams need to move from a linear process to a continuous feedback loop.\nContinuous feedback loop\nThis creative workflow process involves creating dynamic ad templates where creative elements can be added and combined according to live signals, in real time. Then technologies such as Cloud Vision API can analyze visual elements and identify which approaches work best, for example, showing a person in an ad or simply showing the product. With some experimentation and testing, customer insights will build over time and new creative elements can be added into the mix and used in the ad templates. It\u2019s all about continuous, automated improvements to create the most relevant ads.\nA recent report from BCG outlines that a major airline took this approach and built a \u201cdynamic content factory.\u201d The team added between 20 to 40 new creative elements every week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, it had thousands of pieces of content to deploy using artificial intelligence into dynamic templates that combined email, web, and paid channels,\u201d said the BCG report authors.\nLuxury perfume and cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me used this approach as well, with ads built upon a dynamic template and creative assets that were automatically swapped around for improved audience appeal. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand used a continuous feedback loop to update the creative assets based on new customer insights, and these ads ultimately delivered a 31% higher click-through rate compared to static Lanc\u00f4me ads.\nThe dynamic creative were \u201ca great opportunity for our in-house programmatic team to generate actionable consumer insights,\u201d said L\u2019Or\u00e9al Germany\u2019s Head of Precision Marketing Nadine Kamski.\nThis shift toward new creative processes and away from third-party cookies could lead marketers to focus on new metrics to measure their success. While key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates are essential right now, other metrics could become more prevalent in the future. For example, engagement rates, brand lift, and return on investment could become the new standards to measure success.\nThe power of creative marketing is only set to increase, alongside the use of smart automation, as the marketing world transitions to a new privacy-first future.\n\u200b\u200b\u201dThere\u2019s so much to explore on our journey to using data creatively,\u201d says Di Mayze, global head of data at WPP. \u201cCurious data people will drive new kinds of innovation and creativity that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nWhen rethinking your brand\u2019s creative strategy, here are some points to consider."

The campaigns drove tens of thousands of people around the world to sign up as Global Citizens \u2013 a 220% increase on the average \u2013 resulting in one of Global Citizen\u2019s most successful digital acquisition campaigns, ever.Their journey uncovered 5 takeaways to get brands ready for what\u2019s next.\nTo get viewers to act, make action the center of the concept, versus relying on a call-to-action at the end. Protect the Planet leverages ASMR sound effects, visceral immediacy, and a CTA of \u201cStop this\u201d that progressively reveals throughout the ad to trigger viewer action, which resulted in strong click-through rates. Meanwhile, Advance Equity for All pairs an emotionally driven narrative with a YouTube best practice of breaking the fourth wall to deliver high average watch time and conversions per clickthrough.\nFrom striking visuals to emotional appeals, all campaigns experimented with making action integral to the storyline \u2013 driving record conversions for Global Citizen.\nSrinivas Seshadri, Director, Performance Marketing, Interactive Avenues India (End The Hunger Crisis)\nCombining YouTube and Google ad formats in an action-driving campaign can produce more efficient results than using one ad format alone. Each agency developed incredible action-driven Video action campaigns, but when paired with Discovery ads, the campaigns collectively resulted in 28% lower average conversion costs.Creating for multiple formats doesn't have to be complex. You can simply lift stills from your video asset and use them as images in Discovery ads alongside minimal copy and a succinct CTA. For all campaigns, agencies employed this approach to drive more efficient conversions.\nGeane Mota, Executive Director, Client Solutions, Blinks Essence (End Covid For All)\nGetting your audience\u2019s attention \u2014 and holding on to it \u2014 means you have more opportunity to educate, engage, or inspire. A more informed viewer is more likely to click and convert.\nAdvance Equity for All\u2019s impressive click-to-conversion ratio indicated that the longer audiences watched, the more likely they were to click through. So, grab the viewer's attention, then make sure you use it.\nWhether crafting awareness or action campaigns, the principles of YouTube's ABCD framework and Google Ads best practices remain vital. Attracting attention quickly, integrating brand throughout, and authentically connecting with audiences is essential, no matter the campaign. Once you have the attention of the viewer, be direct. Tell them what you want them to do, and show them how to do it. Campaigns with people-focused creative that address the viewer directly, like End Covid For All, perform well.\nAsking audiences to take action only works once they\u2019re already paying attention. So brands need to make sure they\u2019re making use of best practices in order to make that happen.\nChloe Stephenson, Creative Director, BBH London (Resume Learning)\nThe consumer journey is not linear, meaning that brands and agencies cannot operate in silos of creative and performance. To drive more effective and efficient campaigns, brands must break down these barriers.\nAll creative and performance agencies working on the Global Citizen campaigns partnered from the brief, through creative ideation to execution. Working collaboratively enabled campaign efficiencies and ensured all touchpoints across the customer journey were truly integrated.\nAbi Howson, VP, Video, Jellyfish UK (Resume Learning)\nWhether brands are trying to change the world or drive business results, direct response ad formats on YouTube and Google have the power to share stories that drive real action. Brands that harness the power of data-driven creativity won\u2019t only be ready for what\u2019s next \u2014 they\u2019ll be shaping what next looks like.\nWatch all the campaigns.\nThink with Google has added a new destination for creativity to its portfolio.

        "output": "One of the best parts of working at YouTube is being part of the creator economy and enabling next-generation media companies to make the innovative content people love. Just last week, we announced that over the past three years, YouTube has paid $50 billion to fuel the creator economy. It\u2019s inspiring to see how these entrepreneurs are growing their audiences and businesses, while also experimenting with new tools and formats.\nTake Cassey Ho, for example. You might know her better as Blogilates, the world\u2019s most-watched Pilates instructor, who has made Pilates and wellness accessible to millions of people for more than a decade. During that time, she also became the CEO and lead designer of her own activewear company. And over the past year, she started using YouTube Shorts to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at her design process, and to share fitness tips, quick recipe ideas, and more. She does this all while continuing to post long-form workout videos daily.\nHo\u2019s willingness to innovate and embrace new formats in creative ways makes her beloved by millions. By adapting her content to be multiformat, she\u2019s also demonstrating a deep understanding of how viewers discover and watch videos today.\nThat\u2019s because people now move seamlessly between screens, experiencing worlds of content made of what they love, fueled by creators who are experts in what\u2019s relevant. In fact, streaming across different screens, video lengths, and creators is at an all-time high. Whether the content is long, short, mainstream, or personal, YouTube is the one place where people watch it all.\nHow can brands ensure that they are taking full advantage of a multiformat approach? Here are three key things to do.\nYou\u2019ve seen the dances. You\u2019ve heard the viral audio samples. And you\u2019ve probably been fooled by a \u201ccake or fake?\u201d clip at least once. If video is the breakout medium of the past few years, then mobile short-form vertical video is the breakout format. What\u2019s one thing all those short videos have in common? Creators who are constantly shaping and reacting to trends. Viewers can\u2019t get enough of them.\nSince its launch in 2021, YouTube Shorts is now home to 1.5 billion monthly active users and earns more than 30 billion daily views.1 While it\u2019s a mobile destination, Shorts also fuels discovery across formats and screens. Creators who upload both long-form video and Shorts on YouTube see longer overall watch time and subscriber growth. According to YouTube\u2019s latest Culture & Trends Report, 59% of Gen Z \u2014 the world\u2019s largest generation \u2014 agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nWhile viewers favor their mobile devices for short-form vertical video, they\u2019re increasingly turning to another familiar place for long-form online video from their favorite creators. In fact, TV is YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing screen today, with watch time continuing to level up. As of January 2022, on average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.3 The growing popularity of connected devices tells us that the old distinctions between network TV, digital, streaming, and mobile video are fading.\nSome of the shortest videos on YouTube last only a second or two, whereas the longest video on YouTube right now would take you about eight days to watch. Seriously. So what\u2019s the perfect length and type of content to keep viewers engaged?\nWe\u2019ve spent years studying and refining best practices for effective storytelling via short-form and long-form content on YouTube, exploring what makes content \u201cgood,\u201d and defining the ABCDs of effective YouTube creative. We also look to creators. Since the earliest days of video sharing on the internet, they\u2019ve experimented and optimized the length of their videos to find the sweet spot of audience attention. Because of this, they\u2019re a strong indicator of what works on YouTube.\nRight now, creators of all popularity levels are using short-form video as the latest space to experiment with new approaches and engage viewers. South Korean girl band Blackpink, for example, created the #PinkVenomChallenge on Shorts to promote the release of their latest music video, \u201cPink Venom.\u201d The group\u2019s multiformat marketing approach helped them set a new YouTube record: Pink Venom garnered 90.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the third-biggest 24-hour music video debut of all time.\nOther creators like fitness instructor GrowWithJo and dermatologist Dr. Dray have discovered that Shorts help them expand their existing YouTube channel audience and balance out their long-form content. GrowWithJo shares quick workout tips and tutorials on Shorts, inspiring viewers to also check out her long-form exercise videos. Meanwhile, Dr. Dray complements her in-depth skin care content with Shorts that offer bite-sized advice, such as quick answers to questions like \u201cWhat age to start retinoid?\u201d\nAnother way creators experiment is by giving their Shorts a distinctive style that stands out from other video formats. They might use built-in effects and filters, try different editing styles, or add popular audio samples. On top of this, they tend to use short-form video to capture content that\u2019s emotional in nature, whether delivering joy, high drama, or laughter.\nAll of this experimentation with short-form video makes creators an excellent resource for actionable Shorts-related tips. We often look to creators\u2019 learnings and insights when developing tools, templates, and creative best practices for making vertical video ads on YouTube. Here are some of our favorite creator tips for building successful Shorts.\nAs brands take inspiration from creators and experiment with short-form vertical video, they should keep in mind other creative considerations and the availability of automated tools and templates that make video ad creation easy.\nTo take advantage of this new evolution in content and user experience, marketers should think more expansively about their video campaigns and build for a range of ad lengths and screens. They can use this opportunity to break from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to video ads by, instead, adapting creative assets to the look and vibe of the ad environment, whether it\u2019s in-depth, long-form video or casual, short vertical videos.\nThis combination of video ad formats is a recipe for success on YouTube. After all, adding vertical video to the mix gives brands a new creative canvas to tell their story and expand their multiformat strategy on YouTube, which helps drive the results they care about. Plus, Shorts can help brands show up alongside culturally relevant, creator-driven content that viewers love.\nMarketers should also use Shorts as a new way to achieve lower-funnel campaign goals. Because YouTube is a source of inspiration along the shopping journey, short-form video can easily help turn viewers into customers. And brands can now add vertical video assets to Video action, App, and Performance Max campaigns, which automatically scale to Shorts. Early testing shows that adding a vertical video asset to Video action campaigns delivers 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts compared to landscape videos alone.4\nCreators have been at the forefront of multiformat content experimentation, and have seen their YouTube presence and viewership grow exponentially as a result. Marketers can find similar success by studying how people move from screen to screen to watch different video formats, following creators\u2019 tips on how to engage audiences with Shorts, and using multiformat content to drive results across the entire funnel."

        "output": "Elizaveta Orekhovskaya and Artem Ryzhenkov, video advertising managers at global SaaS company Semrush, share the step-by-step plan behind their company\u2019s initiative to increase conversions with no additional budget.\nAt this stage of the pandemic, everyone is familiar with the laundry list of challenges faced by companies around the world: nervous customers, employee churn, supply-chain bottlenecks, and so on. Like the COVID-19 variants themselves, these challenges continue to take new forms with sometimes uncertain consequences.\nIn 2022, with many small- to mid-sized brands embracing digital advertising strategies for the first time, one key challenge is to break through the noise created by this shift in consumer behaviors and subsequent marketing activity.\nAt Semrush, where our business is to help brands manage their visibility on the internet, we faced this very problem as we set out to promote our own niche product with a complex funnel.\nOur customers use the Semrush platform to optimize search engine results and market more effectively online. Our platform simplifies content creation, social media, campaign creation, and competitive intelligence. Our primary goal with our most recent digital marketing initiative was to increase conversions with no additional budget. Here\u2019s how we did it.\nWe started out by investing in search and display traffic. Using keyword-based targeting, we identified an audience of users who were in-market for our product and began \u201cwarming up\u201d these potential customers with display visuals.\nThen we sought new media environments where we could drive performance without going over budget. We chose YouTube as one of these channels, given video\u2019s proven ability to create a story about a product. Our marketing team had tried YouTube before, but as we will see in a moment, its results left something to be desired.\nInitially, we set up our YouTube campaigns manually, rather than automating them. We did this mostly to understand the available optimization metrics. We launched a number of videos and analyzed them based on cost per impression, cost per view, cost per click, and click-through rate. With this knowledge in hand, our team began automating campaigns using performance metrics, such as cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate.\nThe next step was to develop a system for conversion and attribution tracking. Whereas we had previously attributed most ad conversions based on the click alone, we now added view-based attribution of YouTube ads using Google Campaign Manager.\nWith this change, YouTube\u2019s provable value as an ad channel \u2014 particularly at the customer attraction stage \u2014 was far more clear. And these placements assumed privilege of place among our other paid channels.\nOur team then tested every possible audience type, ad format, and bidding strategy. We found that custom audiences worked better for promoting a specific product than it did for a generic brand. In cases with frequently fluctuating budgets and long conversion funnels, a Maximize conversion bidding strategy proved more effective than a Target CPA strategy. And we settled on the skippable in-stream ad as the most effective ad format for its product.\nOnce the preliminary results were available, we set out to optimize our ad creatives and landing pages.\nOlga Denisova, our VP for digital marketing, observed that a better conversion rate at each stage is achieved by having videos of a certain duration, type of content, degree of complexity, and format \u2014 that is, animated or with human actors.\nFor example, at the upper stages of the funnel, we used short videos of up to 15 seconds that featured the product and encouraged trials. For lower-funnel marketing, we presented lengthier videos \u2014 up to a minute long \u2014 with more detail about a specific product feature or customer success story.\nBased on this insight, Denisova and her team began optimizing our video creatives according to the audience\u2019s phase of purchase consideration.\nOur earlier video creatives had basic graphics with lots of text but lacked voice-over and dynamism.\nWe corrected this in newer videos, focusing on more striking visuals with human actors. The CTA was also reworked for different stages of the funnel, and the video duration was optimized.\nOnce we had worked out our optimal YouTube ads settings, we set out to scale up the Semrush channel.\nBased on past experience, we introduced an optimal frequency of seven impressions per day and 10 views per month.\nFor remarketing campaigns, we based our learning strategy on the size of the targeted audience. In the upper remarketing funnel, with its large available audience of website visitors and registered users, we deployed Google\u2019s Maximize conversions bidding strategy. The lower stages of the funnel were optimized for cost per view, since the smaller available audience meant machine-learning strategies were less powerful.\nIt became clear over the course of this campaign that YouTube advertising not only delivered conversions directly, but also contributed to an increase in paid and organic search results. We saw interest in Semrush in the U.S. grow by an average of 72.6% during a Brand Lift study conducted in May 2021, while interest in our Keyword Magic Tool grew by 120.4%. Another video ad campaign in Canada delivered an increase in paid and organic Google search results of 521%.\nSince the pandemic restricted our ability to produce new video assets, we needed to improve our conversion metrics without increasing our budget or the number of video creatives we produced. To achieve this, our team used a new format from Google called Video Action campaigns, designed to drive lower funnel actions such as website clicks and conversions. As a result, the range of our ads expanded, their variability increased, and automated strategies began learning better from the increased number of conversions.\nIn Video Action campaign ads, we found the ideal palette for our new ad creatives. In one A/B test, a combination of skippable in-stream ads and Video Action campaign ads went up against skippable in-stream ads only. The combined strategy clearly performed better.\nOur CPA at the lowest stage of the funnel was 55% lower than that of the in-stream-only campaign. The cost per sign-up also fell 51%. Video Action campaigns cost 91% less, and view-through rates were 3% higher, than in-stream.\nAfter Video Action proved itself to be the superior strategy, not only on the basis of conversion but also in upper-funnel metrics, we launched the format in all automated strategy campaigns. This helped reduce the CPA per purchase from YouTube ads by a whopping 11%."

        "output": "The earliest known car ad told Scientific American readers that its product was a better investment than a horse. Today\u2019s auto brands face a crowded and competitive landscape, demanding more inventiveness. Producing an ad that really connects with the viewer can be a challenge. Creative is one tool you can leverage to make significant differences in ROI, and experimenting makes it easy to adapt and update campaigns at scale.\nTo find out what makes auto ads effective, our team analyzed thousands of auto ads on YouTube to better understand what drove performance. Based on our findings, we determined that these five creative strategies set the most successful ads apart.\nWhen it comes to the first few seconds of an auto ad, put the pedal to the metal. Opt for dropping viewers right into the action to hook their attention, over the more traditional wide running car footage they\u2019re used to seeing. From there, introduce dynamism with quickly paced, contrasting visuals paired with audio and supers.\nThe Cupra Born spot kicks off with a flash of a speeding car and keeps the momentum going by interspersing clips of the car with fleeting shots of engaging visuals to evoke the energy and excitement of being behind the wheel. The fast pace and rapid-fire stimuli grip the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them engaged throughout the ad.\nFacts and specs are important, but they\u2019re not the only things that work to sell a car. Anchoring your story in human experience allows your audience to imagine the tangible experience of the car, and how it might fit into their lives, building a personal, and more powerful, connection to your brand.\nMitsubishi Brazil\u2019s New Generation spot features women from all backgrounds literally and figuratively taking the wheel, including the wheel of a powerful new four-wheel drive. Multiple characters and a powerful storyline give viewers a reason to connect and emotionally invest.\nEngines revving, brakes squealing, tires hitting the ground: These familiar sounds create an immersive experience for viewers, an experience that becomes critical on YouTube, where 95% of ads are played with the sound on.1 Sound effects, voice-over, and other audio elements have been shown to engage people\u2019s attention and help them imagine what it\u2019s like to drive a particular car \u2014 an important consideration for purchase.\nMini USA\u2019s Hardtop 2-Door Hatchback spot amplifies the sound of the engine throughout the ad alongside everyday dialogue and a fun music track, bringing the full driving experience to life in an immersive and relatable way.\nEvery spot is a chance to show off the specs and features that make your car stand out from the rest, and simplicity is key. Ads shorter than 15 seconds are better served by focusing on one or two things, whereas longer ads have more wiggle room. The key is to keep it clear and not force too many messages at once. Have a lot to say? Consider experimenting by breaking up your multifeature spot with several shorter single-feature ads.\nFord US\u2019s F-150 campaign highlights two key features centered around one idea: making work accessible and easy, both inside and out, when you\u2019re on the road. The message is clear and simple, giving these standout features their chance to shine.\nMore than 70% of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices globally,2 so making your ad viewable on a 5-inch screen is a minimum requirement. Think bright, high-contrast colors, tight framing, and large-type supers to make your ad stand out on that small screen. \u201cBut will that translate to TV?\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve seen that mobile-first ads work just as well on connected TVs.3\nVolkswagen Canada uses bright colors and tight shots of their cars paired with large-type supers that add playful taglines to their fleet of SUVWs, ensuring that the ad is not only eye-catching, but memorable.\nUse these five data-backed creative strategies as a starting point for your next auto ad. Each tactic leaves plenty of room for your brand\u2019s unique sensibility. And once you have a strong foundation, try experimenting with different iterations of your creative to see what works best for your specific audience."

        "output": "Each year, the YouTube Works Awards program partners with Kantar to celebrate the most innovative and effective YouTube advertising in the industry. 2021 presented unique creative challenges as marketers faced the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, digital privacy concerns, and new privacy regulations. Undeterred, the brands with the six winning campaigns produced fresh, groundbreaking ideas that masterfully combined creative storytelling and YouTube. \u201cIn years past, there have been some category winners that were just brilliant video. When I look across this year\u2019s winners, everyone innovated and used the platform,\u201d said judge Colleen Leddy, chief engagement officer at Droga5.\nLet\u2019s look at four major takeaways from our winning campaigns and how they ingeniously used YouTube to drive impressive business results.\nBLK, a dating app for Gen Z and young millennials in the Black community, wanted its users to go from online connections to safe, real-life interactions. However, the COVID-19 health crisis still loomed and the COVID-19 vaccine remained a point of contention in the Black community. BLK decided to tap into Gen Z and young millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for streaming music to encourage its audience to get the vaccine. The brand launched a music video on YouTube called \u201cVax That Thang Up,\u201d which was inspired by a classic hip-hop song.\nThough the video stood at roughly two minutes in length and could be skipped, it still received over 3 billion media impressions in the first day. New registrations on the BLK app increased by 30% week over week, and first-time paid subscribers grew by 22% week over week. \u201cThey leveraged skippable and made you engaged enough to not want to skip,\u201d marveled one of our judges.\nIn contrast to BLK\u2019s longer content, travel metasearch site Kayak used quick, 15-seconds-or-less videos to address the effects of COVID-19 on travel. Using its own research and Google Trends, Kayak discovered that, even though many travel restrictions were still in place, Americans actually wanted to travel but needed the reassurance of more flexibility and options when booking trips. In response, Kayak created multiple campaigns that highlighted free cancellation and encouraged viewers to \u201cskip town\u201d instead of hitting the \u201cskip ad\u201d button.\nThe campaign proved a huge success, driving incremental conversion rates as high as 7.5% and raising purchase intent by 20%. John Deschner from Maximum Effort was impressed: \u201cThey helped you get over travel hesitancy in different ways and targeted people that were searching for these things.\u201d\nBlendJet, a blender company with a mission to make healthy food fast, easily appealed to women 24 to 54 years old, but knew it could reach a wider audience. For the launch of its new blender, the brand created a fun, out-of-the-ordinary campaign, which tapped into two wildly popular YouTube trends: \u201coddly satisfying videos\u201d and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). BlendJet\u2019s campaign, called \u201cOddly Satisfying ASMR Blends in a BlendJet 2 Portable Blender,\u201d featured a voice-over whispering clever statements while the blender hypnotically pulverized entire heads of cauliflower, chunks of ice, and more. To make sure this campaign would be seen by people most likely to buy its blenders, BlendJet focused on a custom intent audience segment, using its top converting keywords in Google Search.\nViewers ate it up. The video became a viral sensation that generated millions of dollars in sales. As a result, BlendJet\u2019s return on ad spend grew 569% year over year, and its revenue surpassed its initial target by 413%. Amanda Richman, CEO of Mindshare, praised BlendJet for turning a product demo into \u201csomething so different through the voice-over, the copy. They created content that is spot on for YouTube viewing.\u201d\nNew to the U.S. market, cat food brand Sheba needed an impactful campaign that would resonate with American cat parents. During its research, the brand discovered that cats often woke up their owners at unreasonable hours, like at four in the morning. Google Search data and YouTube analytics showed Sheba that roughly 1 in 3 people turned to their mobile phones during these moments. So Sheba created a soothing, five-hour video that used scientifically proven techniques to get people back to sleep. To promote the video during the day, Sheba released \u201csubliminal\u201d bumper ads. At night, it launched TrueView for action ads that were tailored to people\u2019s middle-of-the-night viewing habits on YouTube. A simple call to action in the ads would then lead tired cat parents to Sheba\u2019s sleep video.\nThe campaign resulted in a 100.9% uplift in brand recall and a 635% increase in searches for Sheba brand terms among those who had been exposed to the campaign. \u201cIt really was the best use of creative and media that I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Traci Spiegelman, VP of global media at Mastercard. \u201cWhen you have a good insight, and find the right creative and media approach, you nail it.\u201d\nOnline dating app Tinder wanted to help the bisexual and bi+ community get more recognition and own the narrative around what it means to be bi+. It launched \u201cOnce Upon a Bi,\u201d a campaign that featured YouTube Creators reimagining well-known fairy tales based on the bi+ community\u2019s experience within the Tinder app. The brand then used TrueView for action to focus the campaign on affinity audience categories that overlapped with the creators\u2019 audiences.\nThe campaign received 3.2 million impressions, 2 million video views, and an average view rate that was 9% stronger than Tinder\u2019s previous campaign. \u201cTaking stories that have been passed on for generations and showing how they reinforce stereotypes, and using influencers and creators to tell the story was a really good use of YouTube,\u201d said Sheryl Goldstein, EVP, chief industry growth officer at IAB.\nDepartment store Target also partnered with a YouTube Creator to help diverse communities share their own stories. \u201cConvos with CEOs,\u201d a video series moderated by creator Hallease, centered on the entrepreneurial journeys of the Black-owned business founders whose products are in Target stores. Along with using paid media, Target promoted the campaign organically on YouTube by posting customer teaser content on its brand channel and publishing a playlist for the series.\nThe campaign garnered over 6.4 million views across all of the videos, over 107,000 hours of watch time, and over 20,000 total engagements on YouTube. \u201cThose convos were really rich and did the job that an ad could not have done,\u201d said Britt Nolan, president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett.\nIn a tough year, YouTube Works Awards winners turned hurdles into inspiration, reimagined content people already loved, appealed to their audiences 24/7, and gave the stage to diverse communities. They proved that a winning combination of clever storytelling and the YouTube platform can produce both viral sensations and enviable business results."

        "output": "Amy Lanzi is the North American practice lead at Publicis Commerce, overseeing product and talent development, and connecting commerce practitioners from across the Publicis network to enable client-centric solutions. Here she explains how YouTube factors into consumers\u2019 shopping journeys.\nThe other day, my hair dryer broke.\nRather than immediately go to the store to buy a replacement, I decided to go online. I started with a simple YouTube search: \u201chow to blow dry long hair.\u201d But an interesting thing happened on my journey across the internet. I found new, related products I didn\u2019t even know existed. And, what do you know, instead of just buying a hair dryer, I bought the whole suite of products.\nFinding surprising products in a brick-and-mortar store is, or used to be, a common experience: that magical shopping moment when you stumble across something new that fits your needs perfectly. But this time, it happened in the world\u2019s biggest video storefront: YouTube.\nThe idea that e-commerce would evolve 10 years in six months started spreading during the pandemic. And while variations circulated around the industry, the concept is proving to be true: In 2020 alone, e-commerce grew nearly 30% worldwide.1\nThis summer, Publicis Groupe partnered with YouTube and Talk Shoppe to understand how the shopping journey has changed, and how brands can help enhance and expand people\u2019s experiences online. Here\u2019s what we found.\nSeventy-five percent of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration.2 This is because people have a shopping discovery mindset when they\u2019re watching video \u2014 and, of course, because there\u2019s so much content out there for them to discover.\nDue to the personalized experience of YouTube, they\u2019re not finding noise, but things that make their experiences and their lives better. For example, average daily uploads of videos with \u201cShop With Me\u201d in the title increased by over 60%, year over year.3\nYouTube is the matchmaker shoppers and brands have always wanted. You never know when a new shopping journey will begin. Importantly, this inspiration results in bigger shopping carts and upsells. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they can make a decision to purchase or not purchase faster.4\nCreators are the heart and soul of YouTube and the most tailored, personalized, shopping confidant someone could have. They are hybrids of a personal assistant and best friend, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.5\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 2021.\nWhen quality information is paired with authenticity, shoppers make confident decisions quicker, instead of leaving items in their cart while they weigh their options.\nMy daughter got me hooked on Emma Chamberlain. Twice, recently, we purchased something after watching her content. Social proof is powerful, and 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give them the best information about products and brands.6\nOf course, not everyone follows YouTube creators, but they can still find help on YouTube along their shopping journey. For these people, creator content is incredibly valuable, because the breadth, depth, and searchability means shoppers can find high-quality information. It\u2019s similar to reviews or star ratings on marketplaces. YouTube is a one-stop shop for the curious consumer.\nFor example, thrifting haul videos, a subset of the ever-popular haul format, in which creators share purchases that they\u2019ve made, have been viewed over 100 million times.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that YouTube\u2019s appeal as a shopping platform comes in exactly the place where brands can sometimes feel uncomfortable: It\u2019s all creator-driven, vast, and not always easy to wrap our minds around.\nResearch has repeatedly shown us that the quality of information matters more to shoppers than production quality. In fact, 87% say when shopping or browsing on YouTube, they feel like they get the highest quality information about products.7\nWhen I think about these insights, I see opportunities everywhere: opportunities for brands to grow through partnering with creators; opportunities for platforms like YouTube to evolve and meet shopper needs; and opportunities to connect in new ways.\nOnline shopping is a whole new ballgame. And brands and advertisers need to adapt in this new world if they want to win big."

        "output": "As marketers, we share a common goal: Convince people to engage with our brands. Truth be told, it can take a lot of work to make this happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always struck by YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard, an annual list of the most-watched video ads of the year. In a world of unlimited content, millions of people actually choose to watch these ads, so it\u2019s useful to consider what makes them so successful.\nWhile no single formula exists for a viral video ad, we can make observations about what works to inspire our own media strategies. Here are three proven approaches to try, pulled from the latest Ads Leaderboard.\nFor its \u201cHarry Potter\u201d 20th anniversary special, HBO Max wanted to reach two distinct audiences: die-hard \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans eager to be reintroduced to the magic of the series and a new generation of younger viewers who hadn\u2019t yet embraced the franchise.\nTo appeal to both groups, HBO Max leaned into a powerful trend: people like watching content that makes them feel nostalgic. With that trend in mind, the brand designed a video ad to give viewers a heartwarming, retrospective experience full of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d memories. Beyond showcasing the cast\u2019s memorable moments, the ad pulled in fans and authentically celebrated their journey too.\nHBO Max used YouTube to power the campaign. As JP Mallo, VP of marketing for HBO Max Originals, explains, \u201cYouTube is often our initial indicator when we release early marketing assets for how our audience is engaging, what sentiments we\u2019re seeing, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re responding to in terms of content themes.\u201d\nYouTube proved to be an ideal home for HBO Max\u2019s ads, since people of all ages gravitate to the platform for nostalgic content. According to a 2022 Ipsos survey, 80% of Gen Z reported watching YouTube to feel nostalgic;1 by running a nostalgia-based campaign on YouTube, HBO Max could appeal to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d enthusiasts, while also grabbing the attention of a younger generation.\nThe campaign launched mid-November with bumper ads, plus non-skippable and skippable in-stream ads to drive awareness and consideration. Then, in the days leading up to the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, HBO Max used YouTube Select to feature the ads alongside premium content. Finally, they concluded the campaign by leveraging YouTube Masthead before and after the New Year\u2019s Day premiere, placing the video on YouTube\u2019s home feed to drive mass awareness. In the end, the approach drove 12.7% awareness lift \u2014 remarkable for a brand with high awareness already \u2014 and reached 49 million unique users.\nWE, Egypt\u2019s primary telecommunications company, needed an ad campaign that could cut through the holiday noise during the busy Ramadan season. To achieve this, it strategized videos that would help viewers understand evolving trends of Ramadan.\nSince WE\u2019s message had to appeal to viewers across multiple generations, the team determined that \u201cthe campaign should include a diverse mix of ads,\u201d says Eslam Nassar, the brand\u2019s head of digital marketing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we turned to YouTube to tell a compelling, creative story across ad formats and screens.\u201d\nWE planned and executed a full-funnel video strategy that leveraged a unique blend of short- and long-form ads. For viewers in the awareness phase, the team launched 6-second bumper ads to tease the campaign and deliver a quick call to action.\nThen, to further engage middle- and lower-funnel audiences, WE created a full-length, in-stream video. This ad was designed to be watched across devices, from connected TV to mobile. To ensure that this long-form ad could fully immerse people in the brand\u2019s unique approach to storytelling, the team relied on YouTube\u2019s four guiding principles for effective video ads on the platform, the ABCDs \u2014 shorthand for attention, branding, connection and direction.\nTo quickly gain the attention of and connect with viewers, the video began with a catchy musical track. WE made sure the distinctive purple color of its logo dominated the video\u2019s visuals to reinforce company branding. To further connect with multigenerational viewers, the video compared and contrasted Ramadan traditions throughout the ages. Finally, the video directed people to take action by signing up for WE\u2019s services so they could stay in touch with family.\nThis multiformat strategy proved successful. Within the first 24 hours, the long-form video exceeded 1 million views. What\u2019s more, its completion rate surpassed the brand\u2019s 2021 Ramadan video by 204% as well as the market average for completion rate by 47%. Ultimately, the campaign reached 79% of Egypt\u2019s YouTube population.\nWE\u2019s digital advertising manager, Ahmed Nageb, concludes, \u201cYouTube is one of most important platforms to help us execute our digital strategies effectively. Because of its vast audience, which can be targeted through various ad formats and devices, we were able to achieve maximum reach, while hitting our campaign objectives.\u201d\nLast year, BMW launched its first ever fully electric BMW iX sports activity vehicle in the United States. To promote this milestone during the Super Bowl, BMW created a 60-second hero video ad that showed Zeus, the mythical Greek god of sky and thunder, retiring to Palm Springs and rediscovering his spark when gifted a BMW iX by his wife, Hera.\nTo extend the ad\u2019s reach during this tentpole moment, BMW made YouTube a core part of its Super Bowl strategy. \u201cYouTube is a great amplifier of content, which not only increased the audience size exponentially but extended the longevity of the spot,\u201d explains Albrecht Pagenstert, head of brand marketing at BMW. \u201cWhat ran once during the Super Bowl lives online and has received millions of additional views.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s strategy hinged on reaching a wide variety of passionate Super Bowl fans through YouTube AdBlitz, the premier hub for fans to watch Super Bowl ads with playlists for the most comedic, dramatic, action-packed, and inspirational spots. Through AdBlitz, BMW could target specific Super Bowl-related video inventory, such as NFL Highlights watched by sports lovers, and Big Game Music Lineups watched by audiophiles.\nOnce the campaign peaked viewers\u2019 interest during YouTube AdBlitz, BMW then strategized to satisfy their hunger for more content. It released behind-the-scenes videos, including interviews with the hero ad\u2019s star-studded cast and director.\nAudiences couldn\u2019t get enough of BMW\u2019s campaign. In fact, many YouTube commenters enthusiastically asked for the hero video to be turned into a full movie. In the end, the video drove 17 million unique views and 970,000 clicks. In addition to being recognized on YouTube\u2019s Ads Leaderboard in the U.S., BMW earned the No. 7 spot in USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter.\nHBO Max, WE, and BMW struck gold with video ads that entertained and engaged key audiences. By aligning their ads with popular YouTube trends, building bespoke creative for different platforms, and following the ABCDs of video effectiveness, these brands showed how to successfully combine immersive storytelling with the power of YouTube."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in the middle of a digital video boom, as alternatives to linear TV grow at unprecedented rates. According to Nielsen\u2019s total TV and streaming report, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time.1 And viewers watch a daily average of over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV devices.2\nSource: YouTube Internal Data, Global, Jan. 2022.\nThis level of engagement informs how viewers feel about ads. In a new study, we found that viewers agree that YouTube ads on the TV screen are more relevant (59%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3 Connected TV gives advertisers a powerful creative canvas to reach viewers when they are highly engaged, streaming their favorite content on the living room screen.\nTo better understand the opportunity for advertisers, these three brands ran experiments to see how effective CTV could be for their audiences. Here are the questions they set out to answer.\nOn behalf of its Ruffles brand, Frito-Lay North America leveraged CTV to engage with some of its core audiences, such as younger families, flavor variety seekers, millennials, and those living in urban areas. The marketing team wanted to understand how increases in watch time on CTV contributed to brand and sales goals.\nIn 2021, Ruffles ran an A/B test with half the media budget delivered across devices as usual and the other half with an increased allocation to CTV. It then compared performance to delivery.\nThe result? \u201cThe higher delivery to the increased CTV cells exceeded our expectations and benchmarks across view rates, ad recall, and sales lift,\u201d said Amanda Corral, senior director of paid media strategy at Frito-Lay North America. \u201cAnd we achieved this without sacrificing CPM or reach. We were thrilled to deliver a strong impact while maintaining efficiency and delivering higher ROI.\u201d\nL\u2019Oreal USA has built its brands with a commitment to consumer-centricity. Across its brands, that has meant committing to cut-through creative. (Think, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re born with it, maybe it\u2019s \u2026 .\u201d You know the rest.) It has also meant constantly refining media and audience strategies that evolve as the brands\u2019 customers do. For the past several years, L\u2019Oreal USA has followed the lead of its customers and ramped up investment in YouTube.\nThe company has honed a tried-and-true approach to creative and reach, and wanted to see how that approach scaled to CTV. So in the summer of 2021, when it was time to lean into upper-format, demand-generating media, L\u2019Oreal USA increased its YouTube investment by 102% year over year. \u201cWhat was interesting about this time was, we were seeing audience behavior patterns around ad-supported streaming and a boom in CTV that we knew wasn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d said Shenan Reed, SVP, head of media at L\u2019Oreal USA.\nThe company ran a meta-analysis across nearly 30 NCS sales lift studies and found that its YouTube activity delivered an average of 6% sales lift for its campaigns. The company also saw a 6 to 1 return on ad spend on YouTube CTV screens. Not only did this prove that L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s creative and audience strategies can scale to CTV, but it also saw that the majority of impact was coming from new consumers. That\u2019s important because, coming out of the pandemic, the team knew the company needed to attract the next generation of new consumers and first-time buyers.\n\u201cOur consumer is still in the living room, but they\u2019re watching a wider variety of content \u2014 content that is more personal, that\u2019s more of the moment. You can ignore that behavior, or you can choose to show up. And we chose to show up,\u201d said Reed.\nDocuSign was initially apprehensive about CTV, since users aren\u2019t able to click through and convert on the TV screen. However, the brand put aside those reservations and decided to experiment by using the channel to increase reach and brand awareness. DocuSign understood the importance of reaching its users wherever they were, including their connected TVs.\n\u201cBefore this test, we didn\u2019t know there was such a large audience on CTV that we weren\u2019t reaching through other video ads,\u201d said Andy Tack, senior marketing manager at DocuSign.\nBy running a CTV-dedicated advertising campaign alongside a regular cross-device campaign, DocuSign was able to isolate and quantify the impact CTV had on its campaigns. The marketing team found that the CTV ads drove a best-in-class 33% relative lift in ad recall. Furthermore, despite worries about barriers to action, DocuSign actually saw a 126% relative conversion lift for its trial sign-ups.\n\u201cWe can now clearly see the value CTV has in our campaigns,\u201d said Tack. \u201cWhether we\u2019re growing brand awareness and recall, or improving consideration and purchase intent, CTV is a critical part of our approach.\u201d\nNo model exists for the perfect CTV advertising strategy. Whether planning media on behalf of a CPG company, reaching new cosmetics buyers, or taking a chance on a new channel, brands of all types are showing what can be done. The one thing they have in common is that their efforts were rewarded."

        "output": "In today\u2019s uncertain economy, video marketers may find it difficult to keep calm and carry on. For most, measuring the effectiveness of their media investments will be a top priority. And while focusing on measurement can help marketers fuel both short-term and long-term growth, not all measurement approaches are created equal. Success depends on having the right media strategies and tools.\nIt may be tempting, for instance, to concentrate only on immediate results during disruptive times. But savvy marketers will combine their short-term and long-term business goals and take a more holistic full-funnel approach to YouTube. Indeed, recent research by Nielsen shows that brands that added upper-funnel marketing efforts to existing mid-funnel campaigns were able to boost return on investment (ROI) by 70%. And brands that added upper-funnel tactics to campaigns that covered the middle and lower funnels were able to raise ROI by 13%.\nProving the value of a full-funnel video strategy requires using measurement tools and tactics that leverage how upper-funnel brand goals and lower-funnel performance objectives play off each other. To do this successfully, marketers can use an effective three-part framework that balances tried-and-new methods with newly emerging measurement practices. Two parts of the framework \u2014 attribution and incrementality \u2014 help set you up for short-term business outcomes, while the third part \u2014 marketing mix modeling \u2014 can help you make smarter decisions for the long haul.\nHere is a deeper look at how to apply the framework.\nThese days, using an attribution model that assigns credit for conversions to different ads that occur across the customer journey should be standard practice. When it\u2019s done right, attribution can help marketers easily optimize their ad strategies. Google\u2019s data-driven attribution model can help you analyze your customers\u2019 journey across Search, YouTube, and Display to discover which touchpoints are most effective.\nWhile attribution can help you uncover and optimize for opportunities quickly, it\u2019s important not to treat it as a stand-alone measurement solution. Relying only on attribution insights to optimize your plans may provide quick growth, but it will come at the risk of not investing in the upper-funnel branding strategies that constantly refuel the pool of customer demand. Additionally, as measurement becomes more challenging in a privacy-first world, having multiple sources of truth instead of relying solely on attribution will be critical. To take attribution to the next level, pair it with incrementality.\nOne powerful way to supplement attribution and take your measurement mix to the next level is to include incrementality. Generally defined as a lift or increase in a desired outcome, incrementality helps you understand the KPI uplift due to your ad. As a result, incrementality can help you better understand the impact of full-funnel campaigns and pave the way for longer term growth.\nThe primary way to measure incrementality is to measure the performance of your full-funnel video strategy using various lift metrics. Google offers an array of solutions to measure lift across the customer journey, including Brand Lift , Search Lift, and Conversion Lift. When combined into one unified view of measurement, Google uses these metrics to showcase the value and impact of YouTube full-funnel campaigns that span all marketing objectives to help you understand the effectiveness of each.\nIncrementality should never be treated as a one-off exercise, regardless of the outcome. Embracing a test-and-learn mindset will better position brands for resilience and long-term growth. Harvard Business Review found that marketers who run multiple tests see up to 30% higher ad performance. Once you have results in hand, optimize your media accordingly. Keep in mind that it\u2019s critical to continue gathering insights and refining your strategy beyond your initial tests. Building experimentation into your overall measurement plan will help ensure that you are consistently optimizing and refining over time.\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is a tried-and-true, privacy-durable way to measure the impact of all YouTube formats across the funnel. It is also an effective way to capture both the short- and long-term impact of marketing investments. Using longitudinal online and offline data, MMMs provide you with the ROI for each media channel. Not only should these studies be used to show how media channels performed in the past, they should be used to optimize your media allocations moving forward.\nResults from MMM studies take into account a combination of variables, so it\u2019s critical to break out YouTube from other video platforms where possible. A Nielsen study found that the return on ad spend from marketing mix models varied by as much as 48% when video platforms were individualized versus when they were aggregated together. And format-level insights provide the most actionable level of granularity, especially when it comes to a full-funnel mix. Inputs matter when it comes to your model.\nEconomic uncertainty can rattle even the most confident marketer. But adopting a full-funnel video media strategy and balancing complementary short-term and long-term measurement practices can help fuel long-term business growth. To ensure the value and effectiveness of your full-funnel strategy, marketers should leverage attribution, incrementality, continuous experimentation, and MMM to drive short-term performance and reach your overarching branding goals."

        "output": "Marie Gulin-Merle, global VP of ads marketing at Google, speaks at a round-table discussion about the AI revolution during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about a meeting I had more than a decade ago, when digital marketing was at the beginning of its mobile revolution. A consulting company was advising me to embrace \u201creal-time\u201d marketing. I was intrigued, but didn\u2019t think it was attainable given the state of the technology we had at that time.\nI was spending my days in the trenches with my teams and agencies. We wrestled with how to create assets across an ever-multiplying set of formats. We scrambled to keep up with trends that would ignite like wildfire, only to dissipate just as quickly. We were manually piecing together the right media mix and trying to figure out how to spend budgets in a way that delivered ROI.\nMore than anything, I dreamed of being able to get out of the weeds of digital execution to focus my attention on our customer connections, the quality of our storytelling, and our business outcomes. I just wanted to get back to marketing. But, at the time, that felt like science fiction.\nNot anymore.\nWe\u2019re all already using AI to reach our customers more efficiently. In fact, 80% of Google\u2019s customers are already using AI-powered Search ads products. Now with generative AI, marketers have a rapidly expanding set of AI-powered tools with the potential to revolutionize every single part of marketing \u2014 from how we mine for insights, brainstorm ideas, and generate content to how we connect with people, drive growth, and measure performance.\nWhen it comes to content, my biggest pain point as a marketer is simple. There are never enough people to keep up with the velocity, volume, and variations required to reach people when and where I need to.\nNow, with new AI-powered tools, my team can scale the creative concepts we love to more formats with unprecedented precision. This means more time and attention can be devoted to shaping core creative concepts. AI can then draw from this source material to instantaneously generate assets like social copy, landing pages, and emails.\nAI can do the same for ads, with alternate ad copy, automatically formatted videos, and multiple combinations of product photos, all leading to infinite permutations of tailored ads for every customer.\nAt Google we\u2019ve been using AI in our ad products since 2015. And we\u2019re already allocating a significant amount of our media spend toward AI-generated creative across Display, Video, and Search, because it has proved to be effective. There are three core areas we\u2019re focused on.\nCreative testing: Google Cloud technology is helping us use AI to score creative, predicting success or failure, before we put it out into the world. In ongoing pilots, we\u2019re using AI to help us weed out poor performers more quickly and to more easily identify potential winners. We\u2019re also working with an agency partner to apply AI to our creative asset library. That way we can understand what has performed well historically and use that knowledge to develop future campaigns.\nCampaign optimization: Our marketing teams do all of their on-stack optimization with AI. Our teams are using AI to identify the best mix of formats and placements to meet our goals across screens and audiences. Although people\u2019s behaviors are complex, reaching them across multiple surfaces \u2014 YouTube, Search, Gmail, Maps, Shopping, and Discover \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be. For example, Performance Max, our AI-powered campaign type, is driving an 18% uplift in conversions at a similar cost per action.1\nMeasurement: In response to people\u2019s increasing expectations for digital privacy, regulators and tech platforms are restricting techniques that advertisers have relied on for decades to reach audiences and measure results, such as device IDs and third-party cookies. We\u2019ve all long relied on huge stores of data to drive performance and measurement. AI is helping us use fewer signals, while driving the intelligence and trusted measurement we need.\nStill, it will take more than a culture of experimentation to capture AI\u2019s full potential. We are making sure we learn and then scale. Only then can we develop a deeper understanding of how and when AI can be deployed to augment and amplify human skills. To make this all as easy as possible to navigate, my team put together a list of AI Essentials that you can use to make sure you have the right AI foundation.\nAs we embark on this journey, what gives us confidence is Google\u2019s bold and responsible approach. AI has incredible potential to benefit our industry, but it is not without risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be responsible from the start. As an example, to address misinformation, Google will soon be integrating new innovations like \u201cabout this image\u201d metadata in Search and image watermarking. We are also using AI to deliver a privacy-first ads experience that drives results for performance marketers while also protecting consumers\u2019 privacy.\nIt\u2019s such an exciting time. The tools and capabilities I could only dream about in my days as a CMO in consumer packaged goods and retail are here \u2014 now. Marketing is about connecting brands and products to people. The \u201cwhat\u201d remains the same. The \u201chow\u201d is changing again. Marketers, we can finally get back to marketing.\nOur marketing teams here at Google have been experimenting with AI tools to be more productive and creative. Take a look."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Marketers are told time and again to factor return on investment (ROI) into their media planning decisions, but putting this into practice can be daunting. It doesn\u2019t help that the media landscape is more fragmented than ever, making it difficult to isolate the impact of any given ad placement, let alone optimize for it.\nAt Google, we work closely with clients to improve media measurement and have come to recognize marketing mix models (MMMs) as the most comprehensive way of understanding ROI measurement across different media channels, spanning online and offline.\nAnalyzing a range of advertiser MMM results over the years has also helped us identify the key contributors to ROI growth for YouTube in particular. Our research shows that there are four primary levers of video ROI: creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience.\nOf course, optimizing each of these levers can look quite different from one advertiser to the next. Every marketer should experiment to understand what works best. Doing so will help them confidently make decisions around their campaigns, resulting not only in better ads but better returns.\nTo understand how each of these work, let\u2019s walk through the stories of four brands that discovered firsthand how these levers increased their ROI.\nResearch has shown that effective creative accounts for almost 50% of ROI.1 Google analysts and researchers have studied thousands of ads to understand what specific elements drive performance on YouTube. We call these elements the ABCD principles: attention, branding, connection, and direction. According to research conducted by Nielsen, ads following the ABCD principles saw a 30% higher sales lift than ads that didn\u2019t adhere to them.2 Google sales teams are equipped to help brands analyze and optimize their creative for YouTube to drive greater business impact.\nShapermint, a global e-commerce brand, wanted to both boost its brand and drive product sales. Over the course of seven weeks, it ran experiments to understand what combination of creative drove the best results in its YouTube ad campaigns. By alternating among user testimonials, product demos, and a special offer, each video had its own unique angle. Shapermint tested the impact of its messaging along with other creative levers, such as length and pacing. As a result, the brand found its optimal combination of creative, assembling a powerful mix that lowered its cost per acquisition (CPA) by 21% and drove 50% more purchases.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start by building out the foundation of your video creative according to the ABCDs, and then try experimenting with various creative elements to see what works best for your audience.\nDifferent YouTube formats serve different objectives, but research shows that full-funnel strategies consistently deliver higher ROI. Brands that combine both awareness and action YouTube ad formats as part of a full-funnel strategy see higher ROI than when using either one in isolation. Based on a custom Nielsen meta-analysis, a full-funnel YouTube strategy drives 10% higher ROI compared to awareness advertising alone.3\nSulwhasoo is a South Korean luxury skin care brand from Amorepacific. Having surpassed $790 million (1 trillion KRW) in annual sales, it is quite well known. However, it wanted to try leveraging YouTube ads to drive more conversions beyond the awareness campaigns it had historically relied on. For this experimental campaign, Sulwhasoo first used a foundation of awareness and consideration formats to maximize its audience reach. Then it layered in action formats for the first time, turning attention into action. With this YouTube full-funnel strategy, the brand saw a staggering 91% decrease in CPA and a 13.8X increase in conversion rate.\nWhile it might seem intuitive to primarily buy action formats in the pursuit of tangible ROI, advertisers will see higher returns by adding awareness formats. In fact, a recent study shows that YouTube advertisers see Awareness formats driving 28% of their conversion assists.4\nThough reach and frequency are closely knit, each impacts ROI quite differently. All else being equal, increasing reach usually maintains ROI, while increasing frequency past a specific point usually diminishes ad effectiveness. For many advertisers, this well-known rule of thumb can make them fearful of increasing their frequencies. However, most advertisers overindex on cautiousness, and, in reality, have more breathing room to increase frequency on YouTube than they might think. On average, brands can increase average weekly frequency on YouTube from one to three ad exposures without diminishing YouTube ad effectiveness, according to an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen.5\nTo simplify the process, we\u2019ve recently started letting advertisers using Video reach campaigns choose a frequency target of up to five impressions per week, helping them to achieve maximum reach while setting a desired weekly frequency. This leads to a more efficient spend and a better experience for viewers. And we\u2019re piloting YouTube reach and frequency data availability through our MMM data platform to help advertisers understand their measurements better.\nFor example, after including reach and frequency data in its commercial mix modeling program with Analytic Partners, Peloton discovered that its ideal optimization strategy was more nuanced than it had expected. The results showed that there was an opportunity to drive incremental reach after optimizing frequency, leading to a potential ROI improvement of 15%.\nLast but not least, who you show your ads to significantly affects your ROI. Every brand has at least one demographic audience, but adding in audiences based on interests and behaviors can help you reach more potential customers. For example, a beauty brand might want to show its ads to viewers who are watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or a pet food company could choose to show its ads to those who recently searched for \u201cbest organic dog foods.\u201d These nuances can make all the difference in final purchase decisions.\nThe Insights Finder tool helps marketers uncover actionable audience insights related to interests, demographics, and more, using aggregated and anonymized signals from Google and YouTube. These insights allow brands to add new audience segments and to see how their ROI is affected. Oreo used Insights Finder to break down their audience into four segments: Entertainment Fans, Trendsetters, Gamers, and Foodies. The brand created personalized creative for each of these segments and saw an impressive 100% year-over-year improvement in YouTube ROI.\nBy focusing on creative, ad format mix, reach and frequency, and audience, advertisers can better understand the contributors to their ROI. Google teams can help brands that are on this journey figure out how to optimize each of these four levers. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned from Nielsen, YouTube return on ad spend grew by 108%, on average, for brands after collaborating with Google, an increase that was 7X greater than seen by brands that did not collaborate with Google.6 Close partnership with our media customers is absolutely key to capturing the power of media mix modeling."

        "output": "From brushing our teeth in the morning to cleaning the kitchen counter after dinner, home and personal care (HPC) products are an essential part of our daily routines. Because these items are ubiquitous, finding imaginative ways to market them can sometimes be a challenge.\nWe know, however, that when it comes to designing ads to break through the clutter, creative has proved to be a particularly powerful tool for advertisers. Our team analyzed thousands of global HPC ads to understand exactly what kind of creative choices make some of these ads more effective than others. What we found pointed us to five creative insights about what resonates with viewers when it comes to HPC ads.\nResearch and development is how brands differentiate themselves. And while R&D is critically important, how brands communicate those differentiators is just as significant. Rather than using complex terminology (whether it\u2019s a little known ingredient or a reference to a scientific process), help people by simplifying the language or concept into a language they can easily understand.\nFor example, instead of describing technicalities, Liquid Plumr shows its benefits through a straightforward test: a universally relatable experience of a sink clogged by the oatmeal and cucumber chunks from a home-spa mask. The ad lets the viewer see the product\u2019s capabilities rather than explaining it, as one pour of Liquid Plumr clears away the clog in a single satisfying visual.\nRather than trying to hit the entire marketing funnel with a single ad, consider the creative choices that accurately address a specific objective. What works to effectively drive short-term sales goals looks quite different from ads that are focused on long-term brand equity. Ads focused on brand building can often benefit from a longer, more creative story, whereas ads focused on short-term sales and performance work the hardest when the focus is on the product itself.1\nWith the release of their new vacuum cleaner model, Bosch Hausger\u00e4te (Domestic Appliances) created a 20-second spot showing the product in action and focusing on one key feature, an approach that proved to be effective in driving short-term sales. However, when it came to creating their brand campaign, Bosch took a very different creative path. The minute-long spot featured a cast of several characters, each with distinct storylines tied together by the campaign slogan #LikeABosch, showing all the ways Bosch can play a role in our everyday lives.\nPersonal care products are just that: personal. People want to see that the product can fit into their everyday lifestyle, and being seen in that process is important. To reach all of your consumers, consider who you\u2019re portraying in your campaigns. More inclusive representation across ethnicities, ages, and genders can drive greater engagement and help your consumers connect with your brand proposition. In fact, representation is the No. 1 driver for ad recall for HPC ads, proving that integrating diversity into your ads can leave a lasting impression.2\nAll Good, a diaper brand focused on sustainability and clean ingredients, made sure to speak to all parents with its campaign. Recognizing that all kinds of families exist \u2014 whether interracial, young, single-parent \u2014 it acknowledges that many parenting struggles are universal no matter who you are. This allows viewers to connect with the brand in a more authentic, genuine way, simply by being seen and heard.\nPeople don\u2019t always have a strong emotional connection to products, especially when it comes to everyday things in home and personal care. Building that connection is vital to engagement and can help a brand stand out. Having a creative, evocative storyline that goes beyond the product can go a long way in capturing a viewer\u2019s attention.\nVeet France\u2019s \u201cYour hair, your choice, our products\u201d campaign walks through a number of poignant vignettes of various women: with a lover in bed, at a lively summertime party, laying in the grass, and admiring their arm hair. By showing a range of body types and body hair, it tells a story of the many different ways one can be a woman. A single overlying narration directly addressing the audience helps send a message about everyone being entitled to their own opinions on their bodies and body hair. Though its products are touted as a way of helping people do whatever they want with their hair, the story goes far beyond the product line.\nPeople usually don\u2019t think about what personal care products sound like, but the use of audio can evoke memories, help us more easily contextualize something, or amplify messaging. Audio is an underutilized resource in video ads despite it being one of the most effective ways to drive lift across brand metrics. Use it to amplify any visual element, like brand names or supers. Audio can also be used for product usage cues, like the spray of a bottle or the splash of a product pour.\nDowny Korea promoted its Puff laundry detergent with a short but evocative spot. When the character squeezes the puff, a sound effect emphasizes the satisfying, squishy texture, allowing the viewer to imagine what it feels like without being able to touch the product. Then, as the puff hits the laundry water, it bursts with an explosive sound. The dramatic, powerful sound communicates how vigorous its cleaning capabilities are.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why these five data-backed tactics can benefit the creative for your next HPC ad. They\u2019ll serve as a starting point for building a strong foundation as you apply your own creative angles that are true to your brand. And to really maximize your ads\u2019 effectiveness, remember to continually experiment with your creative to understand what truly drives the best results for your brand and audience."

        "output": "At YouTube, we\u2019ve analyzed the content and creators that broke through in 2022 to uncover the global insights and themes we believe will help define consumer trends in 2023. Based on what we found, we\u2019ve identified three ways marketers can take inspiration from successful creators to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with their audiences.\nThe most successful marketing shows an understanding of what motivates an audience to engage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to value online communities and understand how they can amplify and strengthen your messages.\nCreators excel at this. The top YouTube content of 2022 demonstrates how creators can inspire active engagement from their communities through moments that capture public attention. In the U.K., for example, British YouTubers Sidemen brought together audiences from many top creators to raise over $1 million during their charity football match. Meanwhile, in the U.S., American creator MrBeast made YouTube\u2019s 2022 year-end list for top 10 creators with a Willy Wonka-themed challenge video, featuring contestants from his fan base. And in Germany, the continued success of collaboration duo 7 vs. Wild can be partly attributed to their viewers, who share their takes in scores of reaction videos.\nAcross moments and geographies, viewers are forging connections with communities online that they may not interact with elsewhere. Indeed, 55% of Gen Z agree that they watch content that no one they know personally is interested in.1\nThe takeaway for marketers? Find ways to encourage participation from online groups who have specific personal interests and lean into them. By doing so, you can create brand moments with greater impact and meaning.\nIn 2022, audience interest spanned multiple formats and content categories, and their preferences often changed based on their mindset and the moment. While this trend may seem like an obstacle, it presents a great opportunity for marketers to follow the lead of creators who successfully reach new audiences by meeting them where they are.\nIn the past year, creators who told stories across multiple formats had the fastest growing audiences. For instance, Indonesian swimmer Timotius Mulyadi, whose long-form videos usually clock in at over eight minutes long, experimented with 60-second swimming tutorials, which made him one of his country\u2019s breakout creators last year.\nFact is, engaging audiences successfully in one format often means that viewers will follow you from screen to screen. Our research shows that 59% of Gen Z agree that they use short-form video apps to discover things that they then watch longer versions of.2\nShakira successfully capitalized on this behavior when she promoted the release of her latest song with Rauw Alejandro, \u201cTe Felecito.\u201d Instead of simply launching the music video, she used a series of Shorts to excite fans and encourage them to watch the full video experience. First, she sparked curiosity by inserting teasers from her new video into the YouTube thumbnails of her all-time classic videos. Then she released a preview of her new video on YouTube Shorts. Finally, she launched a group of Shorts that taught viewers how to do the video\u2019s choreography, which sparked a new dance challenge. This creative use of multiformat content helped her music video become the sixth most-watched in Mexico in 2022 according to YouTube Music trends.\nMeeting your audience where they are also means speaking their language, sometimes quite literally. MrBeast showed up on top creator lists in Brazil and France by using dubbed language channels. Meanwhile, Brazilian creator Jooj Natu\u2019s English-language channel helped him extend his reach into the U.S. and Canada.\nWhile marketers can take inspiration from the multiformat success of these creators, they can also engage with new audiences in a very simple and attainable way. According to a Google study, adding a vertical creative asset to a Video action campaign delivered 10% to 20% more conversions per dollar on YouTube Shorts than using landscape assets alone.3\nIn the past, viral short-form videos often resulted from accidental, random moments captured on camera. But these days, Shorts are less off-the-cuff, and more crafted and intentional.\nThe Shorts that attract the largest audiences have been specifically designed to recreate the spontaneous feel of those older videos, with deliberate moments of surprise and delight. For creative inspiration, marketers can look to circus acrobat Jake Hinga, who found Shorts success by capturing him and his friends undertaking elaborate trampoline challenges. Alternatively, they can see how Chris Ivan, the king of toilet plunger trick shots, reached 80 million views by collaborating with restaurant business, Dave & Busters.\nBut Shorts don\u2019t need to seem spontaneous to be successful. Last year, comedy creators attracted audiences with character-driven sketches and parodies. Take Germany\u2019s Anna Strigl, who encouraged environmental activism in one of the country\u2019s most viewed Shorts of the year.\nThe most important takeaway for marketers is that the best short-form videos embrace the format\u2019s strength and encourage people to watch them again and again. What does this mean exactly? According to our list of top creator tips, one major thing marketers need to do is give their Shorts an immediate hook. As The Korean Vegan, a U.S.-based cooking creator, says, \u201cThe first one to two seconds are the most important. That hook better be visually, audibly, and intellectually irresistible.\u201d\nLeveraging communities, meeting audiences where they are, and creating innovative Shorts aren\u2019t just YouTube strategies. Rather, they\u2019re a reflection of the way audience expectations are evolving. Marketers who incorporate these actions into their creative will empower themselves to successfully connect with the right audiences at the right moments in 2023 and beyond."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you\u2019ve watched YouTube throughout the years, you know it\u2019s evolved quite a bit. Long gone are the days when the content exclusively centered on off-the-cuff vlogs. Now, YouTube is a place that millions go to witness major cultural events. But even beyond that, people are turning to YouTube to experience the moments around these moments.\nTake me, for example. I recently watched Silk Sonic\u2019s 64th Grammy Awards performance on YouTube. Then I found myself watching video after video of related content, like Kyle Hanagami\u2019s choreography to a Silk Sonic song. I went from enjoying one performance at a major event to digging deeper into the culture surrounding that performance.\nThis type of watch behavior is ubiquitous on YouTube, and it gives brands the unique opportunity to make advertising budgets go further and work harder. Recent campaigns from Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z International are proof of this. Here\u2019s how each company successfully used YouTube to stand out, extend its reach, and increase brand awareness during a key tentpole moment.\nLast year, Hyundai planned to debut its new electric vehicle (EV), the Ioniq 5, during the Super Bowl. Angela Zepeda, Hyundai\u2019s CMO, says, \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center.\u201d\nWith more people watching live sports online, Hyundai wisely opted for a multimedia campaign. It aired a TV spot during both the NFL\u2019s AFC and NFC Championship games and again during the Super Bowl pregame show. However, in contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai went digital-first during the Super Bowl.\nAs Zepeda explains, \u201cWe know that digital-first audiences care deeply about keeping their pulse on the cultural zeitgeist, but are less likely to have standard cable and more likely to be cord-cutters. That\u2019s where YouTube came in.\u201d After consulting a Nielsen study showing YouTube as the leader in streaming watch time in the U.S., Hyundai felt confident that the platform would put them front and center with its audience.\nCore to Hyundai\u2019s digital-first approach was investing in YouTube AdBlitz inventory and surrounding its ads with Super Bowl-related content. This included videos directly related to the big game, such as NFL highlight footage, along with content tangentially related to the Super Bowl, like recipes and cooking demonstrations geared toward foodies and tailgaters. By doing so, Hyundai extended its reach beyond the mainstream Super Bowl culture and tapped into the event\u2019s subcultures.\nTiming was also integral to Hyundai\u2019s approach. The company extended its campaign to run for a full month, which allowed it to become part of the Super Bowl hype in the weeks leading up to and following the game.\nThis video content strategy paid off. After the campaign generated more than 247 million impressions, Hyundai became a big brand winner of the AdBlitz 2022 contest, an honor given to brands who receive the most views on their Super Bowl commercial. Additionally, by starting its campaign early during off-peak days, the brand also reduced its cost per unique view by 50% compared to a traditional Super Bowl buy.\nFor Pride Month this year, bubly partnered with the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, and the chosen families and safe places that allow its members to flourish. As part of the partnership, the brand created a short film called Coming Home, which offered a simple, yet powerful message: Everyone deserves a family.\nTo promote the film and ensure it got the viewership and engagement it deserved, bubly knew it was important to find the right platform. As Conor Dwyer, brand communications lead at PepsiCo, explains, \u201cYouTube was among the only platforms where we could functionally and efficiently deliver a video ad that surpassed two minutes and reach an audience already primed for viewing long-form content.\u201d YouTube also helped bubly\u2019s film reach a wider range of relevant audiences through behavioral and contextual targeting, including affinity segments like LGBTQ Content Enthusiasts, and ensure it appeared alongside relevant content.\nWith the power of YouTube behind it, the film earned more than 6 million views and a view rate above 50%. The film also drove heightened interest in the brand, which saw a 1091% relative lift in searches for \u201cbubly.\u201d\nMondel\u0113z decided to promote its Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand during Italy\u2019s biggest national music festival and song contest, the Sanremo Music Festival. This involved sponsoring the YouTube channels for the artists in the festival and running a YouTube homepage masthead during the weeklong event. The brand chose YouTube because it knew the platform would be ideal for immersing in the excitement of the festival and reaching as many music fans as possible. It was a smart strategy, as music streaming had been growing in popularity since the start of the pandemic, especially on YouTube.\nTo reach the largest online audience possible, Mondel\u0113z ran a 25% share of voice YouTube campaign, which guarantees advertisers a set percentage of ads around certain content groups. For Mondel\u0113z, that meant its campaign could run on the official YouTube channels of all the top artists competing in the Sanremo festival. Mondel\u0113z not only extended its campaign reach by leaning into the momentum from the main event, but also by tapping into the excitement before, during, and after the festival.\nMondel\u0113z also secured a YouTube masthead ad exclusively on connected TV. This helped the brand reach a new, fast-growing base of connected TV viewers and keep the Philadelphia brand front and center over the course of the festival.\nIn the end, Mondel\u0113z\u2019 connected TV masthead increased its reach by 30%, and the overall campaign successfully reached 5.4 million unique users, garnering almost 20 million impressions in just 14 days.\nAs video viewers increasingly gravitate online, innovative companies like Hyundai, bubly, and Mondel\u0113z show that it\u2019s no longer enough to simply run ads during tentpole moments. Instead, these companies found wider audiences and increased brand awareness by leveraging YouTube to tap into the subculture and tangential moments around the Super Bowl, Pride Month, and Sanremo Music Festival. Their strategies and resulting success can inspire brands of all sizes to find greater reach and new fans on YouTube."

        "output": "A few weeks ago, I experienced a quintessential New York moment. I was double parked on the busy street outside my New York City apartment, desperately trying to install a car seat I had recently purchased for my 3-year-old daughter. At any moment, I knew I could be honked at for blocking other cars.\nSo I quickly whipped out my phone and headed to the Car Seat Lady on YouTube, a channel I frequently consult when I\u2019m in the market to buy a new car seat and in stressful parenting moments like this. There, I knew I could find step-by-step instructions and incredibly accurate estimates of how long it would take someone like me to install a brand-new car seat in a high-pressure situation.\nMy experience isn\u2019t unique. People all over the world turn to YouTube for help with products they just bought. In fact, they\u2019re relying on YouTube for guidance and information during every part of their shopping journey, whether they\u2019re watching unboxing videos, getting product reviews, or learning from how-to videos. This is particularly true of Gen Z, who say that YouTube is more likely than other video and social media platform to meet their top shopping needs.1\nBut what exactly makes YouTube such a magnet for shoppers? And how can brands benefit from this close relationship between YouTube and its audience? To find out, we partnered with Talk Shoppe to conduct an extensive, qualitative research study and surveyed thousands of video users in the U.S. From our findings, we\u2019ve extracted three shopping insights that can help build brand loyalty and create repeat customers on YouTube.\nYes, discovering new and exciting brands online is important to shoppers. But what they value even more is finding reliable, trustworthy information that will help them buy a product with confidence. And, according to our research, viewers say YouTube ranks no. 1 against video services and social media platforms in key shopping needs, like finding honest information and feeling good about their purchases.2\nYouTube creators are a large part of the reason why people view the platform as a source of solid information, with 87% of viewers agreeing that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust.3 As one of our survey participants said, \u201cYouTubers often give updates on how the product is doing three, six, or 12 months after purchasing, and they also will warn you about things to look out for.\u201d\nSource: Google/Talk Shoppe, U.S., Shopping at the Speed of Culture 2021 study, 24 markets (AR, AU, BR, CL, CO, FR, DE, ID, IT, IN, JP, KR, MX, PE, PH, NZ, NL, ES, SE, TH, VN, AE, U.K., U.S.), n=48,000, 18\u201364 gen. pop. video users, Aug. 20, 2021\u2013Feb. 19, 2022.\nTo explore this further, we spoke with creator-turned-entrepreneur Cassey Ho about how building trust with her YouTube followers contributed to the success of her direct-to-consumer brand, Popflex.\nFor over 13 years, Ho established herself as an authentic, trustworthy creator and CEO by sharing free workout videos on her Blogilates YouTube channel. \u201cFans would see me wearing my products or showcasing them in the background. They started asking me for a longer hoodie or a hoodie with a bigger hood to cover their long hair. What has really helped me build trust \u2026 is that I will take those comments as inspiration to develop my products. People felt heard.\u201d\nWhen we asked Gen Z what they prioritize when they shop using video or social platforms, they ranked finding a brand they love significantly higher than finding something trendy.4 This, of course, is great news for brands who hope to become a go-to destination for Gen Z and other shoppers. But exactly how do they become that universally loved brand? They can achieve this by creating a positive shopping experience that encourages people to buy from them again and again.\nThe key to a positive shopping experience is giving people product information they can trust, which will make them more satisfied with their final purchase. And our research showed that YouTube helps brands build this basis of trust. As one of our Gen Z survey participants stated, \u201cAfter buying something that I\u2019ve actually done research on [through] YouTube, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever returned anything.\u201d YouTube also helps brands win customers\u2019 loyalty, with 85% of people who use YouTube in their shopping journey saying they have purchased or planned to purchase a brand again.5\nSource: Google/TalkShoppe, U.S., Social Commerce and Video Shopping study, n=2,000 gen. pop. 18\u201364, Aug. 2022.\nWhile shoppers trust creators\u2019 recommendations and the information they find on YouTube, can the same be said about video ads? As part of our research, Talk Shoppe conducted a test to find out how people really feel about the ads they see. They created an ad for an imaginary coffee brand and showed survey participants how this ad might look on different online platforms. Participants were then asked to quickly associate the brand in the ad with certain words.\nThe test results showed that people trusted a brand much more when they saw it on a platform they trusted. More specifically, ads on YouTube were rated significantly more trustworthy, established, and credible than they were on every other platform.6 Thus, our research shows that brands can enjoy a halo effect \u2014 positive association \u2014 from the platforms or services they advertise on, which is vital information for brand marketers who want to get the most out of their media dollars.\nThese three shopper insights can help brands leverage the implicit trust people have in YouTube and its creators. By tapping into the satisfaction shoppers have when YouTube is part of their shopping journey and by benefiting from YouTube\u2019s halo effect, brands can turn one-time buyers into long-term loyal, repeat customers."

        "output": "If you ask a room full of advertisers, \u201cWhat makes a good video ad?\u201d you\u2019ll likely get a wide range of responses. But most will agree that good creative drives results. According to Nielsen, creative is responsible for almost half of a campaign\u2019s success.1 And when I recently ran a YouTube CMO roundtable, many clients spoke to creative customization and experimentation as key components of their success. Their experiences support the insight that relevance to viewers maximizes impact. Because different content resonates with different viewers, campaigns containing several versions of the same creative, each tailored to a specific audience, can be very effective.\nAdvancements in technology have led viewers to expect more relevance, thanks to a proliferation of choice. Now, ad creative must transform to meet those expectations. We developed Ads Creative Studio to streamline the production process by helping brands and agencies cut down on time and costs, and to facilitate collaboration between media and creative teams. Here\u2019s how two brands and an agency used the platform to create more effective ads.\nCustomization has always been a key part of PepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy, but their sparkling water brand bubly\u2019s impact on brand associations still had to be tested. The team wanted to find out how customized video ads for the brand might encourage their ideal audiences to associate it with house parties, barbecues, sports viewing, and other consumption moments. The goal? To deliver on a brief to better understand the consumer and eventually win them over.\nWith this experiment, PepsiCo wanted to gauge which of those occasion-specific messages, when aimed at relevant audiences, would resonate the most. With Ads Creative Studio, the process of building out a collection of customized assets became smoother and more efficient. The suite of tools allowed the teams to keep production internal by housing all design elements on a single platform.\n\u201cPrior to using Ads Creative Studio for video customization, we planned a high-level creative and targeting approach,\u201d said Terrence McLaughlin, associate marketing manager at PepsiCo. However, after using the tool to inventory creative variables to personalize, each with its own designated audience, they realized they had to adapt their creative process to be more tactical. \u201cAfter seeing the Ads Creative Studio user flow, we had to break down the elements of our proposed creative to mimic the framework in the platform.\u201d\nWith a single tool, the PepsiCo team was able to standardize processes across functions. As a result, the team found that campaigns with creative depicting social gathering and food pairing situations were most effective at driving brand lift. Equipped with that knowledge, teams can now craft bubly\u2019s stories around themes they know resonate with audiences they want to reach.\nWhen General Motors South America wanted to boost brand awareness of the Cruze 5 model, they decided to lean on customization beyond the basics. Drawing on Google insights, they created an audience strategy that relied on a collection of 14 different groups, including affinity audiences like \u201coutdoor enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cthrill seekers,\u201d and \u201cbeachbound travelers,\u201d as well as contextual audiences: those watching various types of auto-related content on YouTube. Each of these 14 groups would see an ad customized specifically to what would resonate with them.\nThe team was faced with the question of how to produce 14 unique ads, without sacrificing time, budget, or resources. They opted to try Ads Creative Studio.\n\u201cIt allows you to increase productivity and efficiency, both creatively and from media costs and metrics,\u201d said Gianluca Schinocca, media coordinator for GM Argentina. \u201cAmong the many benefits of Ads Creative Studio, production time saving and the large amount of videos produced are the ones that we found most impactful. We also reduced 30% in terms of costs, and, after the campaign, we noticed a huge increase in product searches.\u201d\nFor a true win, GM knew they would need measurable results in brand lift and search. In the end, with a 56% increase in Google searches for \u201cchevrolet cruze\u201d2 and a cost per view 32% less than the industry benchmark, the experiment was a success.\nFrom the agency perspective, Ads Creative Studio can eliminate the swirl that sometimes comes with ambitious undertakings. Creative agencies around the world are constantly dealing with gridlock in approvals and workflows. Men in Green, a Dutch creative agency, found that the suite of tools made it easier for designers to share and edit work. \u201cIt is the perfect solution for our challenge,\u201d said Jaap den Hertog, founder and CEO of Men in Green. \u201cIt gives a risk-free environment for designers to build [ad] creatives. It also allows for easy collaboration between multiple designers.\u201d\nPreviously, to maintain high production standards, Men in Green had strict quality controls in place that only allowed for senior designers to produce data-driven ad creatives within Display & Video 360. That meant junior designers could not create design variations, even when the team needed them. Because Ads Creative Studio is integrated into Display & Video 360, junior designers can now make their own ad creatives, halving the time it takes to deliver work and allowing senior designers to focus on quality assurance and publishing.\nTo their clients\u2019 delight, the data-driven ad creatives with tailored messaging decreased production costs significantly. When leading bath and body brand company Rituals was looking for a way to promote their Easter collection, Men in Green used templates to create personalized messages for each market. Not only did they save time and resources, but they also saw a 278% higher click-through rate, 64% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and 103% higher conversion rate compared to standard IAB banners.\nCreative is fundamental to campaign success. No matter what your goals are, a centralized suite of tools can be used to drive both efficiency and scale. By reducing barriers and enhancing efficiency, Ads Creative Studio makes it easier for teams to collaborate and create personalized assets quickly, at low cost. Coupled with video experimentation, these tools allowed three different organizations to determine the most effective story to engage each of their unique audiences."

        "output": "To explore the future impact of transformational changes in the creative realm, Google is partnering with Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 industry trailblazers on the Open Creative Project: an effort that brings together market analysis and insights from a series of in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders to encourage dialogue about the future of our industry. Here, Abigail Posner, director of U.S. Creative Works at Google, shares early takeaways from the project.\nThe term \u201ccreative\u201d used to refer to a special class within the ad world: teams with a particular skill set who often sat apart, literally and figuratively, from the rest of their organizations. But when a pandemic forced all of us into digital spaces as safe havens to work and play, \u201ccreative\u201d took on a larger meaning.\nPeople who never went to design school or drafted a creative brief got more comfortable being their authentic selves online. Unknown chefs shared their passion for cooking on YouTube and discovered a global audience hungry for more. Gamers live streamed their adventures to thousands \u2014 sometimes millions \u2014 of rapt fans. In myriad new ways and spaces, everyday people started to share their stories, and some even partnered with brands to become powerful co-storytellers.\nMarketers and agencies, too, had to get more creative in solving clients\u2019 challenges, forging meaningful connections with consumers, and measuring success. And as marketers learned how to leverage new tools for creative automation, experimentation, assistance, and measurement, they grew more comfortable sharing ownership of a brand identity with the online communities organically remixing it. Together with those communities, they remade marketing and found fresh opportunities.\nAll of this adds up to more than just a \u201cthings are different now\u201d moment.\nFor us at Google, the combination of changes in consumer behavior, the rise of machine learning, the flourishing of user expression in unscripted spaces, and macroeconomic pressures felt like an inflection point for the industry, one where creative is poised to become the last unfair advantage.\nWith automation flattening media-driven returns, creative is becoming one of the most effective levers to drive differentiation and return on investment, and creative spend is increasing faster than media spend (6% versus 5% annually between 2018 and 2021).1 Knowing that these trends deserved a deep dive, we partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 including Contagious, Benedict Evans, Bain & Company, and 25 creative industry trailblazers \u2014 on what we\u2019re calling the Open Creative Project.\nThrough intensive market analysis and in-depth interviews with dozens of industry leaders and trailblazers, we\u2019ve begun a thorough exploration of the why, the how, and the future impact of transformational changes already underway in the creative arena. And, over and over, we\u2019ve seen that concepts that once felt oppositional \u2014 art and science, unscripted expression and brand voice, advertising creators and users, brand and performance, imagination and automation \u2014 are increasingly interdependent.\nOur goal is to spark a new dialogue focused on the role creative will play in the broader advertising industry over the next three to five years. While this conversation will surely be shaped by the contributions and feedback of the entire advertising industry, we\u2019ve already keyed in on a few areas that present some of the biggest opportunities for marketers and brands.\nA natural place to start is with the rise of the creator economy, one of the strongest signals we have of where the future of creative \u2014 and all of marketing \u2014 is headed.\nThe explosion of truly unique and innovative content the ad industry has seen over the past three years is a direct product of a global cohort of diverse new voices adding their perspectives and contributions to the traditional marketing mix across old and new platforms. Case in point: Influencer marketing payments to creators for creative advertising services grew 50% annually between 2018 and 2021.2\nThe term \u201cowned media\u201d is now a relative one. Not only does every consumer have the tools to amplify, challenge, or riff on your brand\u2019s message through their personal channels and unscripted spaces, but so do thousands of influential creators with their own massive audiences and points of view.\nAnd experimentation, the willingness to try something new or different that\u2019s so key to creativity, is fast becoming a core competency \u2014 especially with the proliferation of tools that enable experimentation.\nThere are lessons here for organizations and brands ready to break creativity out of its silo. By being open to more active collaboration with creators around a shared point of view, brands can foster a more exciting and authentic conversation with their audiences. And there is value in thinking about the \u201ccreative team\u201d as everyone from CEO to the finance team.\nThere\u2019s no question that the relationships between digital platforms and the people who use them are being reshaped.\nBut amid the noise of an internet that offers everything, all the time, how can brands connect with the right people in a way that sticks? The answer lies in the new value exchange that\u2019s redefining how, when, and why brands earn people\u2019s attention, satisfaction, and trust. It\u2019s an exchange that only works reciprocally.\nIn other words, people already understand data\u2019s value for advertisers. When people appreciate the value and benefits they receive from the data they share, the more they trust a brand to handle that data responsibly, and the more comfortable they are with the exchange.\nTo provide a convincing answer to the consumer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d, brands have to deliver empathy at scale by demonstrating a deep understanding of every customer\u2019s (and potential customer\u2019s) needs and the company\u2019s ability to meet those needs. And there\u2019s no better way to speak authentically to the widest possible audience, in the most personal terms, than great creative.\nWith all of the hats they must wear today, it\u2019s fair for marketers to wonder, \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\nBut marketers and agencies can make their jobs simpler and easier on multiple fronts by doing a single thing: embracing automation as a collaborator rather than a competitor. That\u2019s because automation and machine learning can do things that human brains can\u2019t do: connect dots at scale, uncover new insights, free up time across teams, and infuse even more creativity into organizations.\nTake the example of measurement. With so many new content formats, marketers have more data to measure than ever before. But data is only as useful as our ability to interpret and apply it, and automation is a proven tool to drive better performance via modeling.\nAdvertisers are beginning to realize this. Third-party ad technology that supports creativity \u2014 including digital asset management, dynamic creative optimization, advertising attribution, creative applications, and influencer marketing platforms \u2014 saw growth rates ranging from 10% to 30% annually between 2020 and 2021.3\nSo the shift is underway. Of course, automation-enabled measurement doesn\u2019t only make for better creative. Creative thinking can improve the ways we measure.\nToday\u2019s shopping experience extends far outside the store and into the live-streaming, social, and physical worlds.\nAnd as the creator economy flowers across augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming, brands are coming to life across a multiplicity of new dimensions. The implication for brands? Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to convert, and the entire commerce journey is an ever-expanding web of touchpoints where brand building can happen at any time.\nBrands that unlock new ways to stand out in the age of everywhere commerce will define the future of creative advertising.\nWith these ideas as thought-starters, on behalf of our Open Creative Project co-collaborators, we\u2019re excited to open up the conversation to a wider audience. In the coming months, we\u2019ll invite you to dive into a full version of the research report summarized here, followed by a series of contributions from some of the leading voices in creative advertising. We look forward to adding their insights, and more from across the industry, as we endeavor to explore, define, and invent the future of creative, together."

        "output": "Kristen O\u2019Hara is the VP of brand and agency solutions at Google. Here, she spotlights three brands piloting new approaches and stretching their thinking to capture new growth opportunities amid uncertainty.\nIn this current uncertain environment, made more challenging by conflicting news headlines, marketers may have more questions than answers. Strategic decisions tend to get magnified in times like these, and brands often respond by leaning into what they know: tried-and-true advertising tactics that deliver consistent results. While doubling down on what\u2019s familiar is better than doing nothing at all, marketers shouldn\u2019t stop there.\nSearch, video, and insights are tried-and-true advertising channels. Brands know how to leverage them to capture growth and build resilience. But brands also need to supplement their trusted playbooks with the increased insight, speed, and agility that comes from machine learning and automation. We call this combination of tried-and-true approaches and fresh new ways of working the \u201ctried-and-new.\u201d\nHaving served in a variety of roles across the industry, including CMO at Time Warner and chief business officer at Hearst, I\u2019ve experienced challenging times firsthand. Managing the marketing budgets and strategies that many of you hold right now through moments of uncertainty is the moment to focus on purposeful experimentation and lean into the tried-and-new framework. This doesn\u2019t require dramatic changes or major new investments. What it does require is prioritization, flexibility, and a learning mindset. Many leading brands have used this approach to go beyond the performance-oriented tools they\u2019ve relied on in the past to drive better business outcomes. Here are the big takeaways.\nConsumer behaviors, needs, and preferences change from moment to moment, which we see reflected in search. Among the billions of searches on Google everyday, 15% are queries we\u2019ve never seen.1\nWe know that search drives conversions. But with machine learning, you can quickly identify which new searches (or users) are most valuable to your business based on your goals. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve found that full search automation can help advertisers increase conversions by up to 20% for a similar cost per acquisition.2 This is a huge uptick when you are being asked to squeeze more value from every dollar and every campaign.\nWe can see this in action with Rothy\u2019s, a shoe and accessory retailer that relies on video and lifestyle imagery to showcase the quality and colorful nature of their products. The brand adopted automation to surface creative assets to customers at scale across all of Google\u2019s channels, including Search, Display, Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. At first Rothy\u2019s hesitated to automate such important decisions, but \u201cthe results spoke for themselves,\u201d explains Kate Barrows, Rothy\u2019s VP of growth. \u201cAutomation stays on top of customer trends and behavior faster than we can.\u201d The brand grew conversions by 60% and increased revenue by 59%.\nWhat could your brand achieve by offloading commoditized and manual tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work? When you think in those terms, you will begin to see automation as a business multiplier that scales what\u2019s working for your brand, your team, and your partners.\nRemoving tedious tasks, like manually setting your dayparting strategy or building keyword lists, enables your most valuable resource, your people, to infuse more of their own judgment, expertise, and ingenuity into the work. This may mean having the time to focus on building a strategy that expands beyond lower-funnel strategies to develop more holistic, full-funnel marketing campaigns. Or it\u2019s a chance to go deeper on your creative strategy.\nDiscovery+, the streaming platform, adopted Performance Max to improve how it optimizes performance across all of Google\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s advertising channels and inventory. In this case, automation unlocked new audience trends that Discovery+ used to better refine the creative and messaging around their shows. This also freed up time to reinvest into developing a comprehensive media strategy to further drive growth. The strategy worked: Discovery+ increased incremental subscriptions by 17% and decreased cost of acquisition by 21% in a highly competitive category.\nMarketing often suffers from the misperception that it operates as a cost center. Reframing marketing as a growth driver requires speaking a new language, moving beyond proxy metrics like brand awareness or engagement to focus on business performance. Speaking a shared language with the CFO means measuring business outcomes through better use of data, technology, and machine learning.\nWhen you know the value of your customers and you combine that knowledge with AI and machine learning, your campaigns can begin to shift advertising dollars in real time to the most profitable pockets of demand. This is critical, because tying incremental marketing investments to year-over-year sales growth not only increases revenue but also reduces acquisition costs, leading to more profitable revenue. In fact, CMOs who can translate their metrics into business impact are 37% more likely to report revenue growth compared to leaders that communicate strictly in marketing language.3\nFor example, as part of its first-party data strategy, PepsiCo invested in strengthening direct relationships with their consumers by offering a loyalty rewards program that personalizes experiences and optimizes offers based on the individual\u2019s preferences. This enabled their teams to demonstrate results that tied more directly to sales, in contrast with traditional tactics like mass distributions, promotions, and broad communications that were harder to measure. For example, the food and beverage brand embedded its first-party data in its media planning and buying on YouTube. Not only did their media efficiency improve, but for some campaigns ROI increased by 3X. They also leverage this data to make better informed business decisions on new flavor testings, focus groups, and product samplings.\nDelivering continued growth means striking a balance between tested techniques that deliver consistent returns, and the potential upside of new ideas. Brave marketers have long championed this shift. It\u2019s about remaining agile to manage through the now, while being ready for what\u2019s next."

        "output": "Digital transformation is a journey, not a destination. While every journey will be different, we can learn from leading brands as they advance their digital maturity. Here, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global CMO, Aude Gandon, takes us through the company\u2019s approach to global digital marketing.\nStaying relevant in today\u2019s dynamic environment requires embracing constant change. And as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global Chief Marketing Officer, my mission is to accelerate our marketing digital transformation across the entire organization.\nAs a 156-year-old company with more than 2,000 brands \u2014 including icons like Kit Kat, Nespresso, and Purina \u2014 we believe that data and technology, along with our organization\u2019s ability to adopt and activate quickly, are key to maintaining a competitive advantage.\nPart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s success lies in how we\u2019re able to attribute our digital investments to our top and bottom lines. We recently updated our investors on our digital transformation journey by explaining how we\u2019re using data to reach and resonate with consumers at scale, and how that powers growth across our portfolio.\nIn particular, we\u2019ve identified three key areas that are critical to our success and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in: privacy-preserving fundamentals, valuable consumer connections, and ongoing experimentation. Here\u2019s how we approach each one.\nThe first key to our success is a sharp focus on privacy-preserving fundamentals. A critical part of my role as global CMO is to help Nestl\u00e9 navigate the changing advertising landscape, especially as third-party data collection phases out. By treating data protection and privacy as paramount, we've accelerated the use of privacy-preserving technologies across our organization, ensuring that our first-party strategy is future-proof. This means our brands can access high-quality data and continue to deliver personalized experiences online.\nTo drive our privacy strategy, we\u2019ve developed and delivered a global advertising-technology roadmap across all our markets and brands. Doing so has helped us take advantage of privacy features, like consent mode within Google Analytics 4 (GA4), through which we can communicate users\u2019 cookie- and app-identifier consent status to Google. Tags will then automatically adjust behavior and respect users\u2019 choices. In turn, we\u2019re able to safely improve our understanding of consumers across platforms and deliver richer experiences online.\nLastly, we recognize that staying up-to-date on new privacy capabilities requires us to invest in upskilling programs for our talented teams of brand builders around the world. By empowering our marketers to deeply understand the impact and value a technology unlocks, we can accelerate our transformation and put our company on the path to competitive advantage.\nOur second key focus is on building and fostering valuable consumer connections. In particular, our goal is to reach 400 million consumers with our first-party database by 2025. Having direct access to our first-party data \u2014 and turning this data into actionable insight \u2014 is a critical competitive advantage with immediate value for our brands.\nBy moving toward a first-party, data-driven approach and leveraging Google\u2019s privacy-preserving advertising and analytics tools, we\u2019ve increased our ability to offer personalized solutions in real time, track ROI, and improve sales performance. This ultimately helps us make smarter investments, especially amid economic uncertainty, when it is more critical than ever to understand the value of media spend.\nOne powerful example of this is our food brand Maggi\u2019s use of first-party data to inform dynamic ad creative and better connect with consumers in the Middle East during seasonal moments and other special occasions. By taking this approach, the Maggi team improved its return on ad spend by 25%.\nAnother example is how we leverage new audience capabilities to derive value from our first-party data. Solutions such as Google\u2019s advanced look-alike modeling, currently available in beta, gives us more transparency and control when building audience segments by combining our first-party data with Google\u2019s consumer intent signals. Already, this technology has improved our media efficiency and helped drive a 25% uplift in ad recall for one of our pet care brands in the U.K.\nOur final key focus is on experimentation and fostering a culture of experimentation across our marketing teams. To do this, we lean heavily on cloud capabilities that give us the flexibility to try new technologies while strengthening consumer privacy and growing our first-party data. Our \u201cCloud-in-a-Box\u201d program, for example, gives our brands scalable blueprints to unlock the value of machine learning and other predictive technology.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice for our market-leading Nescaf\u00e9 coffee brand in Thailand. Using Cloud-in-a-Box, the Nescaf\u00e9 team routed large volumes of past campaign data to Google Cloud, then used machine learning to predict which creative messages paired with which audiences to deliver the best results on YouTube.\nBy taking this approach, Nescaf\u00e9 improved its cost per view by 17% and invested the money it saved to reach additional audiences, all while boosting ad recall 12%. Most importantly, the team saw up to 90% accuracy in the model\u2019s predictions, when compared with outcomes from the actual campaign.\nBuilding brands that consumers love remains our core marketing ambition. Our continued investment in digital transformation focuses us on understanding and using the power of data and technology to fuel growth potential for tomorrow.\nBy driving a consistent global marketing strategy across the organization, our team has been able to drive change at scale, embracing data and technology to build competitiveness. Our strategic priorities are helping us build resilience through uncertainty, positioning Nestl\u00e9 to achieve long-term growth."

        "output": "Changes are afoot in how people spend their money. Consumers are being more intentional with purchases, making fewer impulse buys, considering more brands, and exploring multiple commerce platforms. Businesses need to move quickly to keep up with this swerve in shopper mindsets, but it can be hard to put change into action amid uncertainty.\nFinding the right balance between tested strategies and emerging tech innovations can revitalize marketing approaches and power long-term growth. At Google, we call this the tried-and-new approach. It\u2019s about doubling down on proven tactics while leaning into new technology to drive success.\nWhat does this look like in practice? We\u2019ve identified a few strategies that position businesses to adopt the tried-and-new, along with examples of two innovative companies that are using Google\u2019s tools to pivot their growth marketing strategy.\nPeople spend more time researching purchase decisions than they once did, and they\u2019re conducting this research across a growing array of platforms. With this change, automation tools have become a critical way for brands to meet their customers across these digital touchpoints.\nA good example of this comes from Est\u00e9e Lauder in Thailand. Despite being one of the world\u2019s largest cosmetic brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder was challenged to keep up with customer search demand as new search queries and keyword combinations emerged daily. People were no longer just searching for terms like \u201cserum,\u201d but new specific searches like \u201cbest serum for the best price\u201d and \u201cbest serum for brightening skin.\u201d\nThe company decided to approach the problem using automation. To capture and convert prospective customers at scale, Est\u00e9e Lauder used Google\u2019s broad match to automate identification of consumers\u2019 keyword searches to make their ads more relevant to prospective customers. The company also adopted Dynamic Search Ads to find exactly what consumers were searching for on Google and used that data to target their ads and fill gaps in their keyword-based campaigns.\nAs a result, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s media performance shot up. Compared to traditional branded keyword campaigns, the company experienced a 15% increase in return on ad spend, a more than 16% rise in conversion value, and an 11% lift in average purchase size.\nKnowing how to reach the most valuable customers and others like them at scale is a powerful growth multiplier. Using automated solutions allows businesses to do this, while controlling what they pay for customer acquisition and tailoring messages to attract customer attention.\nMarketers know they need to measure what matters, but what are the most important metrics when the economic outlook is in flux? Uncertainty signals the need to move beyond traditional proxy marketing metrics and toward the measurement of real business outcomes.\nArizona State University (ASU) had a business goal to enroll more online students for the 2022\u20132023 school year than the year prior \u2014 no small aim given years of declining enrollment across U.S. postsecondary institutions.\nTo drive this outcome, ASU partnered with Google data scientists to use advanced automation solutions in combination with first-party data to identify people who were most likely to enroll at the institution.\nBut ASU needed to embrace new measurement in order to track the results of these solutions and track progress against its goal. The university leaned in to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and adopted Google Tag Manager\u2019s (GTM) server-side tracking. This allowed ASU to measure the results of its first-party targeting, resulting in a 10% increase in observable conversions on its site and an 8% increase in the on-page conversion rate. Adopting GTM tagging also drove a 25% improvement in page load time and 18% improvement in search engine results page position.\nThis increase in conversions drove remarkable impact. For the 2022 fall semester, ASU Online increased enrollment by 6.9% compared to 2021, setting a record for incoming students.\nNew automation solutions handily harnessed the scale of platforms, helping ASU reach the people who were most likely to act at lower cost. And it was able to measure and track this progress in real time using privacy-safe solutions within GA4.\nPreparing for what\u2019s next is always daunting \u2014 and all the more during times of rapid change.\nBut new marketing strategy tools available today can help to augment traditional strategies, deliver reliable results, and drive long-term growth, no matter what disruptions surface. Use the tried-and-new and make your marketing go further."

        "input": "",
        "output": "People encounter more sustainability-related brand messages than ever, and with good reason: According to a recent Harris Poll survey sponsored by Google Cloud, the vast majority (85%) of executives acknowledge that customers are more likely to engage and do business with sustainable brands. Brand commitments to sustainability have proliferated, with sustainability marketing strategies amplifying those commitments \u2014 on food packaging, in car ads, even on energy bills. That means people see a ton of messages about the environment throughout the day. Those messages represent many opportunities to appeal to customers\u2019 values. How they are conveyed is critical to building brand trust.\nWe asked more than 3,000 Americans of different backgrounds to tell us about sustainability messaging that did not resonate with them to get a better understanding of how to connect on this important issue. Using a type of AI called natural language processing, we clustered and analyzed thousands of opinions by theme to identify how people felt about certain visuals, copy, and creative approaches. Here are three of the most common sustainability marketing pitfalls our research revealed.\nU.S. survey respondents knew which parts of their day-to-day consumption were environmentally unsustainable, citing things like plastic use and driving, but they expressed frustration when they couldn\u2019t afford to change their habits.1\n\u201cI wanted to start using compostable and plastic-free products but could not afford them.\u201d\n\u201cI feel helpless when considering the impact of fossil fuel consumption. I can\u2019t help driving my car when I need to.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to buy an EV, but cannot afford it. I would also like solar panels, cannot afford those either.\u201d\nEducational campaigns can have limited or negative impact when they become constant reminders of barriers to change. Awareness of a sustainability-related problem is rarely the sole cause of inaction. Many people today understand their environmental impact and want to do something about it, but not everyone is in a position to opt into a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, paper straws, though better for the environment, are not universally accessible. Walking or taking the bus to work isn\u2019t always feasible. Meanwhile, some sustainable options can be hard to find or more expensive than the default.\nTo avoid this pitfall, highlight easy-to-adopt, impactful options that are also cost or timesaving. Such \u201cco-benefits\u201d of climate action enable people to make the best choices for their own specific sets of circumstances. Case in point: Google Maps now shows the most fuel-efficient routes, which are often the fastest. Interest in fuel efficiency has grown globally over the past year.2 By integrating sustainability into existing products, brands can enhance people\u2019s lifestyles, rather than interrupt or criticize them. Social proof is a powerful motivator, but research shows people underestimate just how many others are taking environmental action. To remedy this, we created a website for Earth Day that highlights climate actions that have gained traction over the last few years and a variety of steps people can take toward adoption.\nWhile dramatic images of destroyed environments may emphasize the urgency of global action, they may also be overwhelming to individuals. When asked to describe \u201cactions or attitudes that could make people feel bad about their impact on the environment,\u201d many U.S. survey respondents pointed to images of landscapes ruined by trash, fires, or pollution, while some pointed to images of animal suffering.3\nDepicting the severity of an issue through poignant creative is a common way to engage people in a cause. Conveying the size of the problem with great urgency should, in theory, motivate people to act. While this may be effective for certain causes, it can sometimes be detrimental to others. Illustrating a massive phenomenon like climate change can easily overwhelm people and decrease feelings of individual efficacy.4\n\u201cI\u2019m only one person. I can\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing pictures and videos of the giant garbage pile in the ocean that is now bigger than the state of Texas ... made my stomach hurt. But I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI always feel bad when I see the changing climate\u2019s effect on animals. \u2026 I feel a little helpless.\u201d\nBrands and companies still have a place when it comes to helping people make positive changes in their daily lives. They just have to put those contributions in context. Rather than depict the harrowing consequences of inaction, focus instead on concrete, small-scale actions that add up to visible improvements. Even one-time changes that lessen impact over time \u2014 such as replacing light bulbs with LEDs \u2014 can empower customers to participate.\nConsider using before-and-after visualizations that show the value of individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 combined efforts. Time-lapse videos can illustrate outcomes in powerful ways. Such visuals show that we haven\u2019t gone past a point of no return and that measures to address the problem can still be effective. Reporting an initiative\u2019s success to date can also make people want to be a part of the solution.\nPeople may react negatively to being told what to do by brands. This type of purpose-driven advertising can be met with skepticism, with some viewing it as greenwashing. Many U.S. survey respondents pointed to insufficient evidence as a barrier to believing a company\u2019s sustainability claims.5\n\u201cMost of the time [sustainable messaging] is just greenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they can show proof [of] what they\u2019re doing to protect the environment, I don\u2019t fully believe it.\u201d\nThe sentiments align with results from a global survey of top-level executives that had nearly 6 out of 10 (59%) admitting to overstating \u2014 or inaccurately representing \u2014 their sustainability activities. Reporting hard metrics can be an effective inoculation against exaggeration. If you are able to substantiate the value of your offerings, those who care about the cause might consider your proposition. At the very least, they might do some research on their end to learn more about your brand and its climate action goals.\nEffective sustainability marketing and messaging is all about delivering reliable information to help people make better choices in the context of their lives. It\u2019s also about unearthing essential data so that people can gauge and compare the impact of different offerings. For retailers, this might mean introducing features that highlight brands carrying Energy Star-certified products, allowing shoppers to filter for energy-efficient options with a single click.\nThe climate crisis is an urgent matter and individual changes to our lifestyles and behavior have an impact. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve \u201cglobal net-zero\u201d by 2050 are linked to consumer choices.6\nWhile businesses and governments have an opportunity to lead the charge, they also have a critical role to play in making sustainable living more accessible and inclusive for all \u2014 by considering the multifaceted lives of customers who are already well aware of the changes they want to make."

        "output": "Kelsey Davis, founder and CEO of Cllctve, a global community portfolio platform that helps brands discover and connect with creators, shares how Black creators are at the forefront of the shifting content landscape, and how brands can credit Black creativity beyond Black History Month. Davis has been featured as a next-gen leader in Forbes 30 Under 30, Adweek, and The New York Times, and is a recipient of the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund.\nGrowing up in Atlanta, I\u2019ve always been interested in the ways business and media converge, especially when it comes to Black culture. Studying video production in high school led me to make so many short films for the Y that they hired me as a freelancer. Local projects like these gave me more visibility and credibility in my community as a video producer. A friend helped me land my first gig with a Fortune 500 brand as a video producer for the Raurfest music festival. The success of the festival led to a meeting with executives at festival sponsor Coca-Cola to talk about my vision for future projects.\nAfter scaling productions early in Atlanta, I started studying film and entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. By my sophomore year, I had traveled the country working on creative projects with major brands, like Puma, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Land Rover, juggling high-profile projects with being a full-time student, finding a job, and building my personal brand as a freelance content creator. It was overwhelming, but I soon realized I was not alone. Many talented students wanted to build their portfolios and monetize their craft. They just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nI saw an opportunity to simplify the gig-finding and on-ramping processes so that young creators could turn their hobbies and passions into careers. From working with marketers, I knew that giving brands a way to discover and manage creator partnerships in one place could be game-changing. That\u2019s what led me to launch Cllctve, a portfolio platform that connects creators with their next opportunity and helps brands easily find and connect with Gen Z voices.\nThe content landscape is changing rapidly, and streaming is at the forefront. Digital video content is much more accessible to consumers, with a range of video lengths, types of content, and production quality. Over the past five years, there\u2019s been a significant rise in digital video-on-demand content as more consumers become creators of content as well. The more tools platforms give people to express themselves, the more content people will create, including branded content. Platforms like YouTube exemplify the cyclical relationship between consuming and creating content.\nThis is the age of the creator economy. At Cllctve, we believe that every human is a creator. We imagine a future where everyone has access to the tools, resources, and network to create the life they want. While many monetization avenues continue to grow, 77% of creators still depend on brand deals for revenue. And brands are looking for talent to help them produce their next campaigns.\nHistorically, Black creators have been among the leading spheres of influence driving the content economy forward. Whether it\u2019s through the storytelling of legendary writers like Toni Morrison, the choreography of revolutionary artists like Alvin Ailey, or the countless innovators of collective movements across genre and craft, Black creators have always achieved their creative visions by using their gifts to create through media that reaches the masses. 2015 proved to be a tipping point, when consumer data caught up to producer impact, and the results showed the influence of Black creators on the content landscape in real time. Black people are also some of the fastest to adopt streaming services. To move into representation beyond Black History Month, brands need to expand the types of Black talent they feature, pay Black creators equitably, and credit them for their contributions.\nBrands need to scout early and often for Black talent, expanding their search to places and people that are often overlooked. The increase in creator-economy activity nationwide gives brands the opportunity to look outside the traditional markets of New York and Los Angeles for talent. Given that the media has the potential to influence so much of how we see ourselves, brands need to expand representation beyond celebrities to emerging creators who deserve to be known. While it can feel more comfortable to reach out to the same circles, it\u2019s important for marketing teams to go beyond the usual roster to find young, diverse talent. Cllctve helps them find this talent by giving Gen Z creators a way to be discovered by brands trying to connect authentically with young audiences. One of the creators on our platform is based in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been able to work with local and national brands to produce content for them remotely, while staying close to his family.\nCompensation is a critical part of hiring the best talent, yet it\u2019s too often overlooked. The creator-economy wage gap between Black and white workers is disheartening, at 35%. This shows that when brands do decide to hire Black creators, it\u2019s at a significantly lower price point than their white counterparts. Even though the data shows that Black viewership is a leading driver of growth, the value these companies choose to invest in Black creators betrays a willingness to profit from Black art while underpaying Black artists.\nThe key to closing this gap is transparency. At Cllctve, we talk openly about how creators can think about pricing, and we encourage our creators to post their rates on their profile so there are no surprises when they connect with brands. We also provide prompts to help both brands and creators start the conversation. It\u2019s important to me that creators have the tools and resources that they need to feel empowered, and that brands know as much information upfront to streamline conversations. That way, everyone gets value out of the partnership.\nFinancial compensation is important, but so is crediting and celebrating Black creatives. Giving credit can look different depending on the project. Often it means using your platform to elevate Black creativity. One brand that actively seeks to credit both Black creators and Black businesses is Target. In a recent series called Convos with CEOs, Target partnered with YouTube Creator Hallease to highlight the stories behind the CEOs of four different Black-owned brands at Target. With over an hour of original content, the campaign garnered 6.4 million views, 20% higher than benchmarks.\nWhile it\u2019s great to use February as a time to prioritize these initiatives, investing in broad and systemic representation of creators should be a year-round effort. To make good on promises to drive equity, brands must embed it into the DNA of their businesses. And that means scouting, paying, and crediting Black creators."

        "output": "Brands are embracing multiformat video as a key marketing strategy, whether they\u2019re exploring how personal relevance influences watching habits across formats or thinking like creators and experimenting with short- and long-form content. And with 80% of viewers agreeing that YouTube offers the largest variety of video content compared to any other platform,1 brands are turning to the platform to bring their campaigns to life across different formats and environments.\nSource: Google/Kantar, U.S., YouTube U.S. Hero Claims 2022, n=2,000 A18\u201364 gen. pop viewers of video content min. once/week, fieldwork completed in Q1 2022.\nWhile multiformat success often means matching your creative asset with the right screen and content type, it\u2019s also critically important to use video formats that are geared toward your marketing goals. Here, we\u2019ll break down what this means in practice by looking at three case studies about brands that combined multiple video formats with cutting-edge creative to drive powerful results.\nNissan wanted to build awareness and excitement for its all-new, all-electric vehicle, Ariya, in a thrilling way. Knowing that music offers a deeply personal, yet universal, experience, the brand dreamed up unique ways to leverage the art form. Since YouTube offers a breadth of ways for music fans to tap into their passions, the marketing team tapped into the platform to reach engaged audiences.\nTo fully demonstrate Ariya\u2019s duality \u2014 that of a serene, Japanese-inspired cabin combined with the thrilling torque of an electric vehicle \u2014 Nissan opted to experiment with YouTube\u2019s popular lo-fi trend, consisting of music videos with chill hip-hop beats and stripped-back production.\nInspired by a popular creator called Lofi Girl, Nissan created its own four-hour lo-fi video, complete with a 15-track playlist and whimsical animation. While creating hourslong content might be considered risky, Nissan felt confident that YouTube viewers would be receptive. As Allyson Witherspoon, Nissan\u2019s global CMO, explains, \u201cIn launching the all-electric Ariya, we looked to build awareness and consideration in ways that could match the vehicle in being exceptionally creative, unique, and trend-leading. That\u2019s where YouTube came in. It gave us the creative canvas to innovate and authentically connect with our audience.\u201d\nNissan ran its lo-fi video across screens using skippable in-stream ads to drive efficient reach, along with a roadblock on Lofi Girl\u2019s channel to increase the video\u2019s share of voice. The team also used a diverse mix of music lineups to surround the campaign with related content, engage new audiences, and meet passionate music lovers already primed for listening across screens.\nIn its first month, the video drew over 7 million views and thousands of positive comments. It earned an impressive average watch time of 15 minutes across all devices, and 19 minutes on connected TV (CTV) specifically. The campaign\u2019s impact proves that with the right creative, the right trend, and the right platform, even the longest-form content can engage audiences across screens.\nInternational fitness brand Les Mills had the goal of increasing sign ups for its Les Mills+ at-home fitness app. To achieve it, the brand sought to make exercise \u2014 an intimidating concept for many consumers \u2014 feel more accessible. This made short, made-for-mobile video the ideal format. And, with YouTube Shorts averaging over 50 billion daily views (as of January 2023),2 Les Mills put Shorts at the center of its plan.\nFor ad creative, the brand repurposed short-form, vertical video content previously developed for social media. Next, the Les Mills team ran a mix of vertical and horizontal Video action campaigns to encourage lower-funnel audiences to sign up for the Les Mills+ app. This approach ensured that viewers would receive the most suitable aspect ratio, regardless of device.\nUltimately, the campaign exceeded expectations by generating a 52% increase in click-through rate, while reducing cost; Les Mills saw a 10% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 16% decrease in cost per impression. And, while people tuned in on a variety of devices, 24% of impressions were generated from views on mobile phones, supporting the team\u2019s strategy to build with mobile in mind.\nAs Michael Fitzpatrick, marketing manager at Les Mills, explains, \u201cIncorporating vertical video has enabled us to reach incremental audiences during their different watch states and, ultimately, drive more people to work out with us on Les Mills+.\u201d His team\u2019s successful approach shows that using multiple formats helps marketers meet customers where they\u2019re consuming content and drive the results they seek.\nFor centuries, winery brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has been known for its prestigious, high-end Champagne. More recently, however, the company has sought to increase brand desirability by expanding its core audience. For the marketing team, this meant a rejuvenation of brand content, with a modern twist. Taking a cue from the popular how-to trend on YouTube, they created The Perfect Serve, a tutorial series aimed at making Champagne culture appeal to a new generation.\nThis series included long-form videos, along with shorter, bite-sized teaser videos. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s creative best practices, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon designed its shorter videos to run as attention-grabbing in-stream ads to attract viewers to its \u201cThe Perfect Serve\u201d YouTube playlist.\nWith creative assets ready, the team considered screens. Since reaching people in multiple watching environments was important, they made a bold choice to run two different campaigns; one meant for viewers specifically streaming YouTube on their CTVs and another that focused on all other devices.\nWhile the two campaigns used the same creative assets, the CTV campaign helped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon marry its engaging tutorials with a screen designed to be immersive and proved to be effective. According to our recent study with Latitude, viewers agree that ads on YouTube CTV are more relevant (59%), unique (55%), informative (52%), and enjoyable (51%) than ads on linear TV or other streaming apps.3\nBoth campaigns performed exceptionally well, but the CTV effort was the most successful with viewers. Compared to the campaign targeting other devices, it drove more than double the ad recall, demonstrating how brands can use CTV to bolster their media strategies and connect with passionate audiences.\n\u201cThe emergence of CTV on YouTube shows us how message and format are intrinsically linked,\u2019\u2019 says Karen Valesella, digital marketing and communications director at Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u2018\u2019Whether it\u2019s very short or very long formats, YouTube offers us a wide range of possibilities to meet all our needs.\u201d Citing its impressive results, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has incorporated CTV into the brand\u2019s broader strategy.\nNissan took a chance on a four-hour lo-fi video to drive excitement for its electric vehicle, while Les Mills successfully increased sign-ups with short-form fitness content. And Mo\u00ebt & Chandon experimented with different formats to boost their brand appeal, ultimately striking gold with their CTV campaign. These campaigns proved how multiformat videos on YouTube can help brands tell their stories and reach the world\u2019s largest video-viewing audience at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way."

        "output": "YouTube is the top streaming destination for viewers of all generations. Senior leaders from media agency Carat share how brands should approach the platform to connect with audiences and drive results.\nAs people of all generations spend less time watching TV1 and more time online,2 it\u2019s increasingly clear that YouTube is now their top choice among streaming and social platforms.3\nViewers come to YouTube for many reasons: to immerse themselves in their favorite worlds through deep-dive content, to catch a new video from their favorite creator, or to find in-depth commentary and analysis. A top reason audiences tune into the No. 1 most-watched streaming platform in America4 is to rewind relevant events5 and discover thoughtful perspectives in a media environment that sometimes sacrifices depth for velocity. This is according to recent research on viewer trends from media agency Carat, youth culture agency Archrival, and Google.\nThis same study demonstrated two other noteworthy insights. First, audiences appreciate having the agency to search for and choose YouTube videos that bring them joy.6 They\u2019re not just passing time watching the latest trends served up on social media. Instead, they consider the minutes and hours on YouTube to be time well spent. Second, a majority of viewers agree that creators are the reason they visit YouTube. This is especially true of Gen Z.7\nThese insights reinforce YouTube\u2019s indispensability to users and present a huge opportunity for advertisers to increase engagement with their audiences. For more on YouTube\u2019s place in viewers\u2019 lives and its significance to advertisers, we asked three agency executives from Carat to share their perspective on how brands can make the most of the unique engagement and relevance that YouTube offers.\nYouTube enables us to place people at the heart of our media approach. The platform offers powerful opportunities for brands to understand the behaviors, preferences, and cultural trends of their target audiences and then use those insights to map consumer journeys and optimize campaign performance at every stage.\nWe know, for instance, that YouTube has unparalleled influence among Gen Z viewers and that 68% of Gen Z audiences agree creators are why they keep returning to YouTube.8 This creator-driven content lets brands establish authentic connections with their audiences, inspire action, and achieve sustained growth.\nYouTube is a launchpad for myriad ideas, making it a valuable platform for brands. Users trust YouTube to provide answers and inspiration; it\u2019s the starting point and endpoint of their online experience.\nYouTube\u2019s large creator community and crowdsourcing aspects contribute to the wealth of content available and provide diverse opportunities for consumer engagement. By tapping into thoughtful perspectives, curating time well spent, and fostering creator connections, we guide brands to make the most of YouTube\u2019s unique engagement and opportunities for relevance. We ensure that brands show up where viewers have always been watching, reflecting what truly matters to them.\nPeople go to YouTube to engage with topics they are passionate about and search for different perspectives. Core users will go even deeper than casual users, journeying through the platform for a variety of opinions. YouTube is not just entertainment for them; it broadens how they see the world and think about key issues.\nYouTube\u2019s role in the media ecosystem has started to shift. As connected TV has started to feel more traditional and social media has become unpredictable, YouTube now seems to sit in a sweet spot between the two. YouTube offers users more control and searchability than social platforms, but the content still feels fresh, unconstrained by the rigid formats associated with TV. Brands should lean into these strengths. By doing so, they can still drive reach within topics of interest, maintain the freedom to play with format, and offer unique perspectives audiences can\u2019t get elsewhere."

        "output": "The final weeks of the year provide a natural opportunity to reflect on the world around us and plan for the future. As 2021 has been another year of change driven by disruptive external events, the year\u2019s top videos \u2014 viewed by 2 billion people across more than 100 countries \u2014 reflect that reality.\nYouTube\u2019s Culture and Trends team reviewed the top videos from creators from around the globe and saw three themes emerge \u2014 community, comfort, and creativity \u2014 that offer a glimpse into what people are watching and what 2022 might hold. Together these themes not only encapsulate where we are today, but speak to broader shifts in society. From a marketing standpoint, these global insights can help brands understand what people are looking for and how best to reach them.\n\u201cGaming\u201d used to be a subculture, but with 2.9 billion people expected to play video games by the end of this year, today it\u2019s clearly pop culture. The $175 billion industry also has a diverse consumer base, with women making up 46% of gamers and 10% of gamers identifying as LGBTQ+.\nGaming\u2019s primacy is reflected in this year\u2019s Top 10 lists. Players from around the world have taken gaming to the next level, using game elements to craft narratives that spark viewer obsession akin to a must-see TV series. YouTube\u2019s most viewed game, \u201cMinecraft,\u201d featured prominently in two of the top trending videos, receiving more than 100 million combined views. YouTube\u2019s most viewed new game, a rhythm game called \u201cFriday Night Funkin\u201d that\u2019s reminiscent of early 2000s craze \u201cDance Dance Revolution,\u201d made the list with an entry from Cory Kenshin. And speaking of nostalgia, another dominant video, Game Night Stereotypes from top creators Dude Perfect, hilariously portrays a cast of characters often encountered playing board games.\nSource: Newzoo, Global Games Market to Generate $175.8 Billion in 2021; Despite a Slight Decline, the Market Is on Track to Surpass $200 Billion in 2023, May 6, 2021.\nFor many creators and viewers, engaging with game content offers a way to engage with each other, whether through live streaming or on their own time. With the huge cultural zeitgeist around gaming, marketers are finding creative ways to tap into this community. Nintendo debuted its new OLED model, highlighting different games and ways to play, earning a spot on the 2021 end-of-year YouTube ads leaderboard. Among other brand integrations, Balenciaga collaborated with Fortnite, Lil Nas X performed for Roblox, and Puma and ColourPop partnered with Animal Crossing.\nThe past two years have been defined by global political and social instability with little ability to guess the future beyond next week. Perhaps in response to this extended period of uncertainty, people around the world engaged in comfort viewing by seeking out the familiar.\nFor instance, some of this year\u2019s top trending videos from around the world are newer versions of videos that previously resonated with viewers. Back by popular demand, Sidemen created a third installment of their \u201cTinder in Real Life\u201d series, while Mark Rober reprised his 2020 backyard squirrel maze with an even more challenging obstacle course.\nJust as familiar content brings a sense of comfort, so does comedy. Many of 2021\u2019s most popular comedy videos centered on relatable, true-to-life events. This video from Canadian creator Jeenie.Weenie, one in a series about her experience as a flight attendant dealing with different types of passengers, has more than 8 million views.\nOther top videos provided a comic twist on the journalistic interview format. Two students interviewed German rapper Shirin David about her lyrics, and U.K. creator Niko Omilana cleverly convinced BBC News to interview him, while also encouraging people to vote. Taking note of the types of content people are engaging with and looking for \u2014 both comfort and comedy \u2014 can help marketers meet consumers where they are with messages that resonate, which is important in times of uncertainty.\nWhereas audiences have embraced long-form videos on familiar themes, short-form video has become a laboratory for new storytelling formats. Hybrid creators who produce YouTube Shorts alongside their long-form videos have illustrated how quick bites can give audiences a novel experience. Chef Nick DiGiovanni\u2019s long-form videos resemble the food content trend that dominated the first 20 years of this century. But his short-form recipes rely on a quirkier, more playful editing style. By creating for both formats, Nick can bake his cake and eat it too.\nSome creators \u2014 like Chingu amiga, a Korean woman living in Mexico \u2014 use short-form videos to highlight cultural nuances. And others share motivational messages and interesting facts. We see this with Indian creator A2 Motivation, whose bite-sized videos and channel have collectively garnered over 6 billion views. By giving us another view of their worlds, Shorts offer an expanded way for creators to connect with audiences.\nFor marketers, sometimes short and sweet works well, whether that\u2019s giving people a look behind the scenes or demonstrating a new way to use your product. Japanese restaurant Horumon Shimata went viral with a warning video showing that dangerously hot car temperatures are capable of cooking raw meat. The brand regularly posts behind-the-scenes food videos that subtly promote the restaurant to diners.\nAs we reflected on 2021, themes of community, comfort, and creativity popped up repeatedly in the videos YouTubers around the world chose to watch. These are not fleeting trends, but broader indicators of the kinds of content consumers need and the creators they love. Marketers who embrace these themes in their video and ad creative will evolve with their viewers and connect with key audiences in the moments that matter."

        "output": "David Mataranglo is the U.S. CEO at Reprise Digital, a performance marketing company. Here, he shares how to create an agile business that\u2019s ready to tackle today\u2019s challenges and be prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow by focusing your marketing on customer behaviors.\nClosing out this calendar year, businesses are likely realizing that uncertainty is the only certainty. A parade of headlines \u2014 covering labor shortages, supply chain delays, inflation, and uncertain financial markets \u2014 dominate the news and suggest that volatility will persist. As a result, changes in consumer behavior will likely continue, sending a clear signal to brands: Adapt or be left behind.\nAt Reprise Digital, we help ensure that the brands we work with are agile and ready for whatever the future holds. We do this by focusing on how consumers move along the path to purchase, and analyzing and assessing those behaviors holistically, rather than in siloed channels. This approach allows brands to design their marketing around consumer behaviors, which positions them to thrive, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nA great example of this is the work we\u2019ve done with dermocosmetic skin care brand NEOSTRATA and its e-commerce strategy.\nOperating a direct-to-consumer business model, the company sought to efficiently drive traffic and online sales despite having limited awareness. In partnership with Reprise, NEOSTRATA piloted a new approach using Performance Max, which leverages automation to optimize Google and YouTube campaigns in real time. More specifically, this helped the brand hit its predetermined goals by identifying the right ad creative and the right ad placement to reach the customers most likely to convert.\nThe campaign\u2019s results speak for themselves: When comparing three months of Performance Max data to the previous three months of standard Shopping campaigns, NEOSTRATA saw a 91% increase in revenue at a 65% increase in spend, all while increasing efficiency 16%.\nWhile every brand is unique and will see different results, you can follow this example \u2014 and deliver consumer-centric marketing while staying agile \u2014 by employing three key steps. First, enhance your first-party data strategy. Then use automation to optimize your marketing for the right customers. And finally, build a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience.\nAs the economy tightens, many brands are tempted to shift their advertising focus to performance and results. With increased scrutiny on ROI, marketing teams will need to work smarter, using data to achieve greater scale and better outcomes without sacrificing effectiveness. This requires having a sustainable first-party data strategy in place.\nFirst-party data can create new value for your marketing, improve ad performance, and help you deepen relationships with your customers. To build a strong strategy, it\u2019s critical to know exactly what data you need to collect from customers and have a clear plan for how it will be used. For example, NEOSTRATA identified its website visitors, particularly those who did not make a purchase, as a crucial audience to help drive the highest quality leads.\nAs you develop your strategy, keep in mind that value exchange is paramount. You must give your customers something of value in return for their consented data, such as early access to new product launches, personalized recommendations, exclusive products, and other unique offers.\nIn times of volatility, brands should shift their focus away from generalized outcomes, like the number of clicks, toward customers who are the most valuable and profitable. And because customer journeys are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to measure, leveraging automation is increasingly important.\nWith automation, it\u2019s possible to focus your campaign reach on those online customers who are most likely to shop with your brand. Tools like Performance Max, for instance, allow you to promote products across a range of channels, and ensure that you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. This capability becomes even more powerful when you\u2019re able to combine it with first-party data you\u2019ve collected and build lists of people who may be interested in your products.\nAutomation becomes even more significant when you factor in nuances like fluctuating demand across markets, because it can keep pace with shifting consumer behavior faster than a manual, human-led process. In this way, automation can be a particularly vital device for keeping your business agile and ready to react to changes in real time.\nWe certainly saw this with NEOSTRATA. Using Performance Max, the marketing team was able to optimize their Google Shopping feed, regularly rotate ad copy and collateral, and develop a complete set of audience signals, like website visitors and purchases used to target new customers. And all of this was done at scale and across new formats like video, which is crucial for driving conversions across a full-funnel strategy.\nIncreasingly, brands need to think beyond in-store versus online, linear versus digital marketing, or mid-funnel versus lower-funnel conversions and embrace a more connected, omnichannel customer experience. Indeed, a recent survey by McKinsey found that 75% of U.S. consumers say they\u2019re going both online and into stores to research and buy products across categories.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? A fully connected customer experience collapses the traditional marketing funnel and authentically reflects how people are actually shopping today. For example, people increasingly use the internet to discover new products and often end up buying products immediately after researching them. So what has traditionally been an upper-funnel activity is now also a purchasing opportunity through various shoppable media. This means that every connection you make is a chance to acquire a new customer.\nDuring the past couple of years, NEOSTRATA focused on expanding their approach from selling products mainly in dermatology offices to selling directly to consumers. That meant the brand needed to create experiences that make it easier for customers to convert throughout the funnel, whether they were comparing different skin care products through Search or discovering the brand for the first time on YouTube. In fact, combining search and video is especially important, as research shows that YouTube advertisers see brand videos driving 28% of their conversion assists.1\nAmid a volatile economic forecast, it\u2019s more important than ever for your businesses to adapt and stay agile. You can set yourself up for success by developing a smart first-party data strategy, leveraging automation to find the most valuable customers and creating a fully connected, omnichannel customer experience. With these tactics, your business can drive growth now and capitalize on new opportunities in the future."

        "output": "A version of this article first appeared on the YouTube Blog on February 27, 2023.\nEquity and inclusion are at the forefront of YouTube\u2019s mission. Upholding it means that our teams are constantly exploring how our norms, practices, and policies may inadvertently create bias and inequity on the platform.\nThis is why, in 2020, we established a dedicated Racial Justice, Equity, and Product Inclusion team to ensure that the voices of historically underrepresented communities were incorporated early into the development of our products and protocols. Since then, one of the team\u2019s core programs \u2014 called the Inclusion Working Group (IWG) \u2014 has played a critical role in embedding equity into YouTube\u2019s platform and business.\nWe created the IWG as a resource to help our employees consider key risks and opportunities during the development of new products, processes, and policies. It consists of a dedicated product inclusion lead, executive sponsors, employee resource group (ERG) representatives, and leaders from across YouTube \u2014 including experts in machine learning and responsible AI.\nWhile we have a long way to go, the IWG has been a significant step forward in YouTube\u2019s commitment to driving equality. We also acknowledge the power of sharing our progress, with the hope that it can help inspire others to tackle inequality with us, together.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re eager to share three key things that have helped the IWG succeed.\nBeing user first is core to everything we do at YouTube, and it\u2019s imperative that our users see themselves and their lived experiences reflected in our products and policies.\nDelivering on this requires teams to consider equity and inclusion early and often in the development process, so they have time to identify and mitigate risks, and adjust direction when necessary. The IWG makes this possible.\nThe group partners directly with teams to understand how they plan to use machine learning, whether facets of identity are considered in their products, whether new launches may lead to undue hate and harassment, and more.\nAlready, we\u2019ve seen the IWG\u2019s contributions help teams improve a range of projects and programs. For example, it directly influenced the creation of new safety protocols for the first-ever all-female broadcast of a Major League Baseball game last summer. The IWG also helped improve how we detect racially insensitive comments on YouTube, prepared our teams to better identify and respond to new forms of online hate, and provided constant advocacy for the safety and diverse representation of Creators in product launches.\nBy design, the IWG gets its strength from its members \u2014 a consultative, cross-functional team of professionals that span YouTube\u2019s product areas, varied ERGs, and its executive leadership.\nIn addition to its members\u2019 vast expertise and experience, executive sponsorship and buy-in are essential to formalize and champion the IWG\u2019s role. The group helps to mitigate risk and improve the overall quality of product launches by assembling voices from across multiple functions and underrepresented groups to consider questions of inclusion.\nTo date, the IWG has partnered with YouTube teams on over 900 projects. In 2023, the program will expand its coverage to 100% of YouTube\u2019s product teams and range of collaborators. It will also provide guidance on how to prioritize equity across product strategy and to increase visibility among teams. Additionally, the IWG will focus on educating teams by sharing learnings from case studies, research, frameworks, and other content to continue driving scalable ways of thinking equity-first.\nWhile this work will take time and thoughtful discussion, we are motivated by the ways it will benefit the entire YouTube ecosystem for years to come. We acknowledge there is much to do and look forward to sharing more of our progress as we continue this work."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Flying cars may have been a sign of the times on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d but in real life, electric vehicles (EVs) are ushering us into the future. Just as gas-powered engines replaced horse-drawn carts a century ago, EVs are disrupting the industry and setting the standard for the next hundred years of auto innovation.\nIn short, EVs are taking over. EV sales in the U.S. rose 62% in the first half of this year, and now make up 5% of new car sales. While this may sound small, it actually marks a tipping point for EV adoption. The shift to EVs could also accelerate rapidly, as drivers are still feeling squeezed by higher gas prices. In fact, searches for \u201cbest gas mileage\u201d are growing globally by 90% year over year.1 And, according to industry analysts, about 45% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.\nThese numbers have helped automakers see the EV light. They\u2019re investing over $526 billion in an all-electric future, which includes building new assembly lines and parts, learning to produce and store batteries, and preparing for changing tax implications.\nBut is their marketing keeping pace too? As brands work to get EVs in the hands of consumers, many auto marketers are still relying on an outdated playbook. Here are three ways they can rethink stale strategies and make their EV marketing as electric as their vehicles.\nAn avalanche of EVs is coming, leading to a crowded marketplace. The 2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Car Wars report projects that by 2026, 60% of the new models launched will be electric or hybrid.2 And more models mean more choices for auto shoppers.\nIn addition to a crowded market, automakers will also have to contend with the fact that EV models do not have the same level of brand recognition that gas-powered vehicles do. Indeed, 1 in 4 consumer searches for EVs are unbranded.3\nThis means automakers need to build brand recognition for new vehicles now to be well positioned and top of mind when EV options increase for shoppers. One way to achieve this is through video ads that can differentiate a brand\u2019s EV from the competition by touting its unique selling points. In our studies, we found that 80% of new auto purchasers took an action after watching a video,4 such as searching online for more information, visiting a dealer website, scheduling a test drive, or creating custom specifications for a new vehicle online.\nTo see how high consumer interest in EVs is, you only need to look online, where searches for EVs are accelerating. People are also looking for more detailed information about EVs, which suggests they might be heading further into the consideration phase. For example, while searches for \u201celectric vehicle\u201d have grown 87% year over year globally,5 more detailed searches like \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d have also grown by 80%.6 And searches for \u201cbest electric cars 2022\u201d have grown in the U.S. by over 5,000% year over year.7\nThis gives brands the opportunity to meet people in search results and answer their most common questions and concerns. This in turn will help brands become a major part of customers\u2019 path to purchase, guiding them every step of the way. But which search subjects should brands focus on?\nAccording to Gearshift, the most researched topics by people interested in EVs are general explorations of EV or hybrid vehicles, vehicle charging information, maintenance, and environmental benefits.8 And notably, the top two concerns that prevent people from considering EVs are anxieties over vehicle charging or range and other technological issues.9\nPotential EV customers may be at an all-time high for consideration, but they\u2019re very unsure about making the final purchase. Most potential buyers are undecided on whether or not to buy an electric car, and most of them won\u2019t end up converting.10 In the end, just 33% of new U.S. car buyers who considered a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle bought one.11\nApproaching hesitant buyers with outdated marketing tactics and a one-size-fits-all message probably won\u2019t make much of a dent, especially since the EV market is evolving so rapidly. Brands must be able to zig as customers zag and deliver tailored messaging to varying customer segments with different needs and concerns.\nTo do this at scale, brands should use automation and machine learning to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time. The real-time data from automated campaigns can also help brands learn more about potential customers and easily tweak their messaging to increase its effectiveness. By using these modern marketing tools, brands can convince hesitant buyers to choose a vehicle of the future.\nAs consideration and sales of EVs rapidly increase, automakers can set themselves up for success by using video to differentiate their brand and EV models from the competition, appearing in EV search results to answer customer questions, and leveraging automation to deliver the right message to a wide range of consumers.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Whether it\u2019s pressing the reset button or discovering new cultures, travel can be a restorative and inspiring experience. But for many LGBTQ+ travelers, it comes with underlying stresses.\nBoth during the planning stage and on the trip itself, they can feel forced to hide their authentic selves. Traditional booking touchpoints, such as the research phase or checking in at the chosen accommodation \u2014 which should be part of the fun \u2014 become a source of anxiety.\nAmon Versteeg, senior director of business marketing at Booking.com, knows from personal experience what this is like. So he worked closely with his team to introduce the Travel Proud program, which helps to make travel a safer, more enjoyable experience for the LGBTQ+ community.\nWith hospitality defined as \u201cthe friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers,\u201d feeling welcome is an intrinsic part of the customer experience. And when it comes to creating inclusive hospitality, Booking.com\u2019s motto is \u201cyou can\u2019t truly experience the world if you only show up as half of yourself.\u201d\nThis underscores what prompted the birth of Travel Proud \u2014 \u200b\u200ba training and certification initiative for the hospitality industry to ensure the LGBTQ+ community can travel safely and experience the full joy of travel, no matter who they love or how they identify.\n\u201cThe LGBTQ+ community is not accustomed to being 100% themselves. Over time and over history, we\u2019ve learned to suppress a part of who we are,\u201d Versteeg explains.\nThis means that LGBTQ+ people tend to travel with what Versteeg describes as a \u201cdetective mindset,\u201d constantly searching for clues as to whether they will truly be welcome at their chosen destination, even if it is advertised as inclusive tourism.\nVersteeg\u2019s aha! moment came when he was planning a safari with friends, and they found an incredible ecotourism site. He checked an LGBTQ+ inclusive lodging directory, found the lodge there, and excitedly told his friends.\n\u201cMy friend didn\u2019t understand why this was important, so I explained I didn\u2019t want to get to the middle of the safari and find out there would be an issue with my husband and I. My friend then said we\u2019d just have to tell them we were brothers if that happened.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s not innate to everyone to think about this. It still grounds me.\u201d\nTo better understand the needs of LGBTQ+ travelers, Booking.com conducted a survey to gauge the community\u2019s lived experiences. It revealed that more than half of LGBTQ+ travelers have had a less than welcoming travel experience.\nThis includes situations that are not necessarily intentional but can make people feel unwelcome or stressed while on vacation. For example, 20% of those surveyed had staff assume they would need separate rooms or beds when checking in as a couple, while 1 in 5 have felt the need to change their behavior \u2014 and 16% to change their appearance \u2014 to avoid judgment or awkward interactions with accommodation staff or owners.\nVersteeg\u2019s team also identified keywords and feelings from each travel touchpoint, such as researching where to stay, the actual process of booking (for example, does the property booking page use gendered or binary terms only), the arrival at the property, and their experience during their stay.\nThe results were striking. \u201cA word that repeatedly came up throughout the journey, from research through to check-in at accommodation, was \u2018caution.\u2019 And it soon became clear that \u2018safe\u2019 means \u2018good.\u2019 And at the end of the journey the emotion is \u2018relief,\u2019\u201d says Versteeg.\n\u201cFor example, when someone in our trans community is checking into accommodation, and they provide identification with a gender different to how they\u2019re presenting: This is a huge moment,\u201d Versteeg explains. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for companies to really show what welcoming looks like. Whether it\u2019s avoiding gendered pronouns or knowing that it\u2019s OK to ask what your guest prefers. That can have a huge impact.\u201d\nTravel Proud seeks to address this issue. Property owners who host on Booking.com receive coaching from Hospitable Me, which specializes in diversity and inclusion training for the hospitality industry. This training guides property owners on how they can make their venue more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ travelers, and provides tools to grow awareness and understanding. In turn, they will be featured as an inclusive destination on the Booking.com site.\nAs well as the number of venues that signed up to the program (10,000 and counting), Versteeg notes that he was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of properties that are now listed through Travel Proud, from small one-off rural destinations to major venues. \u201cIn a short time, we already surpassed 10,000 properties achieving the Proud Certified standard in our key focus markets.\u201d\nTravel Proud is a big part of Booking.com\u2019s work to deliver more authentic experiences to travelers. For LGBTQ+ travelers specifically, Versteeg states the need to challenge the meaning of what good travel means. \u201cUltimately, a good experience should be more than a safe experience. When we hold a mirror up, we ask \u2018Have we done this for everyone?\u2019\u201d\nFor other companies wishing to make similar strides, Versteeg advises starting small: \u201cFocus on understanding what would make a difference in your organization, and then turn it into many small steps. See it as a continuous journey rather than a destination.\u201d"

        "output": "Marketers are under strain as the economy and privacy regulations continue to shift at a rapid pace. Eighty-nine percent of marketing decision-makers agree that leadership is raising the pressure on them to demonstrate ROI, according to research that Google recently commissioned with Kantar.1\nAs a result, finding effective ways to assess how well your advertising works, while remaining privacy-conscious, is more important than ever. In this environment, how can you be confident when making decisions that set up your business for growth?\nAI-powered solutions can strengthen confidence and deliver better outcomes, all in a privacy-safe way. But to get the most from these solutions, you need to lay the groundwork and get the essentials right. By building your first-party data strategy and setting up a privacy-first digital marketing foundation, you can unlock better measurement and effectively collaborate with AI to drive business results.\nTo deliver results today and drive sustainable growth tomorrow, focus on these four key areas.\nPrivacy and performance aren\u2019t at odds. AI-powered solutions enable you to balance the two and unlock advantages for your business. This is because the predictive and analytical capabilities of AI deliver improved ROI while filling the measurement gaps created with the phaseout of third-party cookies.\nThe first step is to implement a first-party data strategy. This requires thoughtfully communicating with your customers when gathering consent about how you do and don\u2019t use their data. Research suggests that a proactive approach to privacy can give marketers a significant leg up with consumers.\nIn a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 49% of respondents said a positive privacy experience with a second-choice brand would convince them to choose that brand over a preferred brand.2\nOnce you\u2019ve built a durable foundation of first-party data, you can unlock more accurate measurement and gain a clearer view of the customer journey. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.\nThe marketing team at Calendly, a scheduling automation company, understands that a privacy-first marketing strategy is only as strong as the technologies that support it. So they built a privacy-safe measurement infrastructure that allowed them to focus on their most profitable customers.\nThrough sitewide tagging, Calendly defined the type of user that would sign up for an account and push for larger team adoption. Next, it joined the brand\u2019s online and offline data to better understand the customer journey. Within 10 months, Calendly had a full-funnel view of its highest-value prospects and customers. Furthermore, this site-tagging implementation helped the marketing team convince leadership to invest in long-term data and measurement infrastructure. As Jessica Gilmartin, CMO of Calendly, shares, \u201cby connecting Google AI to our product and customer data, we\u2019ve been able to prove the ROI of our marketing investments to our executive team. It\u2019s completely changed the game for us.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve made gains in first-party data collection, AI-powered solutions like modeling, predictive targeting, and analytics can inform your measurement strategy \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have user-level data. This fusion of innovation and privacy will help you take your business to the next level while being responsible stewards of people\u2019s data.\nPrivacy-first data collection is only the first step. A natural follow-on opportunity is to use AI-powered insights to better understand what\u2019s working well. For example, the Insights page in Google Ads uses AI to help you predict rising search trends, understand performance changes, and uncover new audiences that may not conform to your typical customer profile. Insights like these give you an alternate view of your customers\u2019 characteristics and behaviors \u2014 including ad engagements \u2014 so you can connect with them in more meaningful ways.\nSearch agency Solutions 8 used Google AI to uncover surprising insights on behalf of a food industry client. Solutions 8 ran a Performance Max campaign for its client, a producer of shelf-stable food products marketed to a particular type of customer, namely \u201cdoomsday preppers.\u201d Thanks to the Insights page in Google Ads, the agency soon learned that audiences with an interest in boating and sailing significantly outperformed the client\u2019s traditional audience. With that knowledge, it created assets for this previously unrealized customer segment and started a new campaign for the sailing audience.\nBy combining first-party data with insights, marketers can take decisive actions that lead to improved ROI and business outcomes.\nGoogle AI can help you achieve more precise campaign performance by predicting future consumer behavior and constantly optimizing to your KPIs.\nFor example, German online retailer Baur turned to Google Analytics 4 predictive audiences for a recent Google Ads campaign. By targeting an audience of likely purchasers, it achieved sales growth of 56% and an increase in conversion rate of 87%. In fact, Baur calculated that 70% of these customers could only be reached using these predictive audiences in Google Ads.\nYou can also use audience and performance data to inform AI-based solutions that maximize results over time. Take Smart Bidding, which uses Google AI to optimize your bids in every auction and increase conversions based on your goals. Using Smart Bidding, the French automobile brand Citro\u00ebn saw a 16% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) by implementing a value-based bid strategy.\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. We encourage you to adopt an iterative mindset so you can operate as confidently as possible. A spirit of experimentation will validate that your measurement and our AI powered solutions are working in a world with fewer individual identifiers.\nFor instance, advertisers who use marketing mix models (MMM) should use experiments to calibrate those models. A single experiment may be sufficient to effectively modify your MMM. When Google commissioned Nielsen to use NCSolutions\u2019 sales-lift results to calibrate its mix models, the revenue and ROAS attributed to YouTube increased 84% on average.\nThe majority of that volume was previously attributed to base variables (brand distribution and pricing), thus reallocating that volume to YouTube improved marketing results overall.\nBy directly validating what\u2019s working, you\u2019ll be able to combine your own learnings with Google AI to enable more accurate measurement and deliver results for your business.\nWe\u2019re at a critical moment in our industry. Our goal at Google is to give you confidence that your first-party data foundation, audience modeling, and measurement setup are all working hard to deliver results for you. With AI-powered tools at your fingertips, you can rest assured that you\u2019re building the most effective and cost-efficient measurement strategies possible while respecting the privacy of your customers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In preparation for the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Adrienne Hayes, Google\u2019s VP of marketing for global devices and services, spoke with Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD\u2019s president and CEO, about why LGBTQ inclusion in marketing and media is good for business. Hayes is also a GLAAD board member and serves as global executive sponsor of Google\u2019s LGBTQ employee resource group.\nIn recent years, companies have increasingly recognized the value that diverse, inclusive, and equitable marketing practices bring to their brands. For marketers, this has been deeply clarifying. Every creative choice we make has the power to shape how we see each other. Inherent in that responsibility is an incredible opportunity: to create work that positively and authentically reflects the world.\nWhile historically excluded from advertising, the LGBTQ community in the U.S. has seen positive movement toward greater inclusion and diversity in brand marketing and increasing acceptance by the general public. A report published last December by GLAAD \u2014 the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer media advocacy organization \u2014 and the Edelman Trust Institute found that Americans are 2X more likely to buy or use a brand that publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding LGBTQ rights.\nAlong with this momentum, however, there have been plenty of setbacks. Marketers in the U.S. are likely familiar, for instance, with recent backlash experienced by one major retailer for displaying Pride Month merchandise, and the scrutiny experienced by a major brewing and beverage company after partnering with a transgender influencer. These mixed signals \u2014 rising consumer support on the one hand, push back on the other \u2014 can leave brands unsure of their own inclusive marketing plans.\nSo what does the data actually say about people\u2019s attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and what should brands be doing \u2014 with confidence \u2014 to honor their inclusive marketing commitments?\nGLAAD recently released two studies that can be instructive. Its ninth annual Accelerating Acceptance study, which examines acceptance and attitudes toward LGBTQ Americans, showed that a record number of non-LGBTQ Americans support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. Support is quite literally at an all-time high. But an analysis of representation in advertising tells a different story.\nThis month, GLAAD\u2019s Advertising Visibility Index \u2014 an inaugural research report offering a data-backed reality check on LGBTQ representation in U.S. advertising, along with prescriptive guidance for brands \u2014 indicated that the LGBTQ community\u2019s size is not accurately reflected in ads and that current methods of inclusion are not always apparent to consumers. The takeaway is that there is room for improvement for the vast majority of brands.\nRecently, I sat down with Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO at GLAAD, to discuss the two studies and identify actions that marketers can take today to make their marketing more inclusive.\nSarah Kate Ellis: Our findings are really significant for marketers. For instance, we found that 3 out of 4 non-LGBTQ adults feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, which seems to validate that the backlash to inclusive ad campaigns really is coming from a small, though loud, number of activists. Inclusion is not only good for the bottom line, but when consumers are exposed to LGBTQ people and their lives in the media, that exposure has a profound impact on shifting culture and changing sentiments. Sixty percent of non-LGBTQ adults agree that seeing LGBTQ people in ads make them more comfortable with people who are different than themselves.1 So inclusion actually creates a more accepting society.\nEllis: Yes. We\u2019ve seen influencers and celebrities increasingly used in brand advertising, in general, and over 70% of inclusive ads we studied featured LGBTQ celebrities.2 But here\u2019s what is interesting: When it comes to LGBTQ representation, inclusion of an LGBTQ celebrity is the least important factor for consumers, LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ. What they\u2019re actually looking for are displays of empathy and humanity, followed by realistic storylines, like families sharing meals or couples holding hands.3 People want to see the everyday, human stuff. It\u2019s realistic stories over celebrity endorsement.\nEllis: While it\u2019s distressingly loud, it\u2019s actually far from the norm. Only 17% of consumers say seeing LGBTQ representation in brand advertising would make them feel more negatively about a brand. And only 16% of consumers say they would be less likely to purchase that brand\u2019s products or services.4 At a time when 1 in 5 Gen Zers in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ, the calls for inclusion will continue to grow and be louder than the critics.\nSo negativity exists, but it\u2019s a really small portion of people who feel that way. Inclusive marketing is everywhere, and just because a few brands get called out by a loud minority, does not mean that inclusive marketing will end. While the headlines focused on a few brands that tried to appease critics by changing Pride campaigns, so many other brands stood their ground and that supposed backlash faded.\nEllis: Absolutely. We posed all of these questions about LGBTQ representation, and while we know it\u2019s become both more common in some circles, it\u2019s become more contentious. But what was unexpected was that a lot of people aren\u2019t even noticing LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly two-thirds of consumers believe LGBTQ representation is explicit enough to be noticed by most people, but less than 40% of consumers noticed the representation in LGBTQ inclusive Super Bowl ads.5 So even when it\u2019s happening, people aren\u2019t always aware of it.\nEllis: Well, for starters, this is bigger than marketing. Seventy percent of non-LGBTQ consumers want companies to show public support not just in advertising but in sponsorships and hiring as well.6\nBeyond that, I think the biggest takeaway for me is the idea that representation means more than existence, more than the old \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer\u201d model. Today, it\u2019s more about being an integral part of your community. We\u2019re your neighbors and your co-workers; we\u2019re in your congregation and in your family. We\u2019re part of the fabric of society, and marketers must show that. LGBTQ people have the same desires and needs as every other American. We buy cars and laundry detergent, and we worry about our kids and our bills just like everyone else. That\u2019s the story folks in the LGBTQ community want told, and it\u2019s the story that needs to be told.\nAt Google, we\u2019re always striving to increase representation, especially during big moments, but it\u2019s imperative this remains a focus year-round. These findings are a great reminder that our work is never done and that our approach to inclusive marketing can still be improved if we want to stay relevant now and in the future. For example, my team worked on Google Pixel\u2019s Super Bowl ad this year, which featured queer artist Doja Cat. GLAAD tested this ad as part of the Advertising Index, and a majority of consumers who viewed it didn\u2019t recognize any LGBTQ inclusion. It\u2019s on us, and fellow advertisers, to seize the opportunity to tell more realistic, human LGBTQ stories."

        "output": "We\u2019re in the middle of a third paradigm shift. The first shift was the arrival of the internet, with its revolution in information and services. The second was the explosion of mobile computing, driven by the adoption of smartphones. And today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to deliver transformations that are even more profound, for both consumers and businesses.\nKristen O\u2019Hara, VP of brand and agency solutions at Google, addresses a crowd of conference goers about the AI paradigm shift.\nAs with the internet and smartphones, the emergence of AI is a critical development for businesses. But how best to strategize? Naturally, it\u2019s important that we exercise caution in the face of uncertainty to mitigate potential risk. As with any powerful new tech, we must actively work to understand AI and its implications for our customers and marketing activities. Remember, we\u2019re not competing against AI, we\u2019re competing against businesses that are already using AI.\nThe good news: Chances are, you\u2019re already using AI. Here at Google, we\u2019ve been layering it into our products for years. From autocomplete in Search to captioning on YouTube to Translate\u2019s mastery of over 100 languages, our products have gotten steadily better as a direct result of this technology.\nEighty percent of marketers are already using at least one AI-powered Search ads product as a business multiplier right now.1 And tests have shown that advertisers who upgrade their exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns using a target cost per acquisition can see an average of 35% more conversions.2\nPerformance Max offers another useful example. With this product, advertisers bring their business objectives, first-party data, and some creative assets. Google AI will then optimize marketing campaigns across Search, YouTube, Discovery, Maps, and more, meeting customers wherever they are. Advertisers using Performance Max are seeing an 18% uplift in conversions, up 5% since last year, showing just how quickly Google\u2019s AI models are advancing.3\nPerformance Max is about to get even more powerful. We recently announced we\u2019re incorporating generative AI to make it even easier for advertisers to create custom assets and scale them in a few clicks. Just provide your website, and Google AI will learn about your brand, populating your campaign with text and other relevant assets. We\u2019ll even suggest new images generated just for you, helping you stand out to customers across a wide range of inventory and formats.\nWith the power of AI, we\u2019ll discover endless possibilities for creativity through direct collaboration and experimentation. Today, AI can help you write a form letter or optimize your media mix. Tomorrow, it may overhaul your creative workflows, freeing you up to solve entirely new creative and strategic challenges.\nFor example, AI is helping The New York Times organize 7 million photos from over 100 years of reporting. Working with Google Cloud, the Times has digitized its vast photo collection, which had been stored in hundreds of filing cabinets three stories below street level in a space called the \u201cmorgue.\u201d But digitally storing the pictures is only part of the story. To make the archive accessible and useful, the Times used AI to \u201cread\u201d the images, not only by scanning text in the images and notes written on the back but by recognizing objects and places in the photographs, preserving annotations, and making the archive searchable. Now Times journalists can use this resource to report stories rooted in deep historical context.\nGenerative AI is opening up even more possibilities, and we are rapidly moving to a world where the constraints on what you can create in digital spaces are limited only by your imagination.\nWhat will this mean for all of us as marketers? For one, the gap between coming up with a great idea and deploying that idea will shrink considerably. For example, the new Product Studio tool uses generative AI to help businesses of all sizes create a range of high-quality product imagery. Product Studio can create custom product scenes for seasonal or trending opportunities, remove distracting backgrounds, or even increase the resolution and sharpness of your product photos without having to go through expensive reshoots.\nThese are powerful technologies with consequences for individuals and organizations that are still not well understood. As we move boldly toward this future of creative possibility, we must take a responsible approach. We can\u2019t see around every corner, but we can anchor to principles, respond to challenges that arise, and partner with researchers, governments, and communities to ensure we get it right.\nI\u2019ve been asking myself and my team some tough questions as we navigate this third paradigm shift. Here are a few questions you can ask as your teams figure out how to harness the power of AI."

        "input": "",
        "output": "For years, marketers have been integrating AI-powered products into nearly every aspect of their work, gaining critical insights and driving more conversions with improved campaign optimizations.\nMore recently, the profusion of news surrounding generative AI has renewed the critical importance of the human in the driver\u2019s seat, especially when it comes to building advertising creative. Commercial creative would not exist without the talent behind it, full stop. And just as marketers have been using AI-powered tools, creatives have been experimenting with AI in everything from ads that talk back to concept decks that sing.\nWith responsive search ads (RSA) and responsive display ads (RDA), we\u2019ve already seen the ability of AI to optimize thoughtfully crafted assets into the best-performing combinations of creative. We know that AI can scale asset production to serve the most relevant version of an ad across channels via Performance Max, App, and Video action campaigns. Now, to get a pulse on how interdisciplinary creative teams are already exploring AI, we asked agency leads across three regions how they use it. Here\u2019s what they said.\nDuring the 2019 holiday season, a team tasked with selling the Google Nest to Australian shoppers had a unique opportunity to let people test the product from the comfort of their own homes.\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the experience of Nest into the ad itself, so that was the moonshot then \u2014 essentially, quite a while back before generative AI was a thing,\u201d said Tingyan Han, senior data strategy director, APAC at EssenceMediacom. \u201cWe needed to demonstrate the many ways in which Nest makes moments at home better.\u201d\nTo do that, the team turned to a speech-to-text API co-authored by Google with the help of the Google Nest and Google Media Lab teams.\n\u201cThere were many considerations when working with a speech-to-text API, from the UX to ad inventory and measurement, all the way down to testing whether local accents were recognizable,\u201d said Han. The ad would pause within the first few frames to allow the user time to opt in to the experience. When users said, \u201cHey Google, show me gingerbread house recipes,\u201d it would do as told.\nThe activation led to an increase in consideration to purchase. Vincent Tay, creative director, APAC at EssenceMediacom, says that\u2019s because the interactivity served to demonstrate the benefits of the product itself.\n\u201cWhile the thought of integrating new and shiny technology into every facet of our campaign can be alluring, we must always remember to place the human truth at its core,\u201d said Tay, who partnered with a UX/UR designer alongside Han on the campaign.\nMore recently, Publicis-owned Leo Burnett Australia used AI to build a talking car; Leo Burnett Taiwan used another kind of AI to celebrate Lunar New Year with potato chip-inspired fortunes.\n\u201cWe have been using Google Colab regularly for early prototyping efforts involving up-and-coming AI algorithms,\u201d said Laurent Thevenet, head of creative tech at Publicis covering APAC and MEA. \u201cWe are also starting to use Bard, as we like the fact that it is connected to the internet and can retrieve real-time information.\u201d\nIn addition to sending regular updates on emerging tech to its 4,000 creatives across the region, Publicis is also mentoring talent internally, sending mentees back to their respective agencies and teams with new knowledge.\n\u201cMachines need operators and, for the creative industry, it means that creatives will partner with machines, directing them towards the desired output,\u201d said Thevenet. \u201cThese creatives have to be hybrid talents able to think critically while having the ability to operate and connect these emerging AI systems with one another.\u201d\n\u201cImagine a concept store on the moon. What does that look like?\u201d\nEd Yeoman, creative director at London-based branding and design agency Human After All, has observed his team bringing AI into the ideation stage to collaborate on design fiction for this type of \u201cwild-card idea.\u201d\n\u201cSome people use it to get verbal prompts around language and messaging, and some people use it to get visual prompts to help them kind of imagine something that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d including events and event spaces, he said.\nGabriel Cheung, Global Executive Creative Director, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, says AI-generated content can also challenge teams to push their thinking. \u201cBecause of the way AI works with existing information, we let AI-powered tools quickly generate the \u2018first thought\u2019 ideas. Our thinking is that if AI can generate the same idea, then we haven\u2019t done our job well enough to come up with something new,\u201d said Cheung.\nGoogle recently announced a new conversational experience in Google Ads and Search campaigns that can be used to enhance brainstorms, a use case Yeoman\u2019s team found helpful.\n\u201c[The prompting] part of the process \u2026 puts you in the role of the creative or strategic director,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cOftentimes, at that level, you\u2019re helping to frame challenges for people to inspire them to do certain things. It\u2019s the same with AI. You\u2019re hoping to frame this challenge in a way which gives you an optimal output.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s announcement of the forthcoming addition of Adobe Firefly to Bard represents a commitment to ethical image generation. Firefly is trained on a catalog of hundreds of millions of licensed images in Adobe Stock. As private technology companies develop responsible AI and call for regulation, creative agencies are writing their own ethical guidelines.\n\u201cWe felt that there was a little bit of a lack of people talking about what it meant for humans,\u201d said Yeoman. \u201cAt the heart of our business are the principles of empathy and reason. We try and build those into everything.\u201d\nEvery year, global creative agency Jellyfish Group invites its own technologists to a companywide hackathon. The participants invited to this year\u2019s event in Paris received a new kind of challenge: design an AI-powered solution for improving the quality and performance of creative assets. The event brought 120 technologists across data, media, and creative together to address this critical business need.\n\u201cThe benefit is huge; it elevates everyone\u2019s knowledge and experience, and that carries throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Sam Yates, chief solutions officer of creative technology at Jellyfish.\n\u201cAI has developed so fast and there\u2019s so much opportunity, but it\u2019s also kind of a wild West scenario,\u201d said Di Wu, VP of data science at Jellyfish Group. \u201cPeople are just starting to think about regulation and what it means for us to adopt AI. We created a task force around it to basically say, AI is not just about ethics; it\u2019s literally a business problem for us. If we\u2019re not using AI the right way, it could lead to bias because of the training samples used [to train the hypothetical model].\u201d Agencies will soon have access to more tools to create variations on their own work, ensuring ownability.\nWorking within established partner networks is one way to ensure safety, added Yates. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stifle innovation in any way, but we do have to think about some of the risk mitigations that go with exploring new technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking closely with Google, for example, is a great opportunity for us to explore a tech stack in a safe and responsible way.\u201d\nEven before the milestones of 2023, Google had partnered with Jellyfish to design a bespoke service powered by Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Vision and Video APIs. \u201cOptics\u201d could decode which elements of an ad performed best according to a brand\u2019s goals and best practices like the YouTube ABCDs. With advances in AI, such methodologies could eventually enable teams to distinguish emotional content across ads, or even the presence of humor, to shed light on which creative choices resonated most with their brands\u2019 audiences.\nOnce teams have finalized creative assets, they can get the most out of them using smart creative formats like RSAs and RDAs. Tools like Performance Max can help make sure the right ad reaches the right audience at the right time, optimized for their chosen channels and screens. Research shows that advertisers see 2X more conversions, on average, when adding an RDA to an ad group with a static display ad.\nFrom creative testing to storyboarding, AI-powered solutions have a pivotal role to play in the future of creative development. The role itself must be defined by the needs of real creative teams, and some of the most useful applications may be found unexpectedly. Through active exploration and experimentation with AI, we can discover more concrete ways of thinking about the guardrails we want to uphold and the benefits to creative professionals they unlock."

It's important to include the following facts in it. \n- Companies that have successfully achieved digital success have leaders who can confidently change course and face uncertainty.\n- Next-generation leadership is characterized by operating outside traditional comfort zones, thinking cross-functionally, and elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\n- Building a digitally savvy organization requires leaders to embrace change, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.\n- Cross-functional collaboration and monitoring initiatives outside of marketing contribute to better revenue growth.\n- Active and engaged boards of directors, consisting of the right people and encouraging creative thinking, can support digital transformation and innovation.",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In the final entry of our three-part series on digital transformation, Google\u2019s Courtney Rose shares how next-generation leaders deal with uncertainty. Part one focused on how organizational shifts help companies transform, and part two explored the role of a strong relationship between CMO and CFO.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent times, the only certainty companies have is uncertainty. This can be challenging for organizations who strive to be digital first, as rapid industry shifts can easily pull their focus away from continuous innovation.\nBut some companies have figured out digital success. When we recently teamed up with Kantar to study how these companies navigated dynamic markets while preparing for the future, we saw a common trait: All had leaders who could boldly face the unknown and confidently change course at a moment\u2019s notice. These leaders transformed the fabric of their organizations, cultivating open-minded, collaborative approaches that sparked innovation, and did it in the face of constant change.\nOur research underscored that this type of next-generation leadership is defined by three behaviors that other companies can implement. The first is proactively operating outside traditional comfort zones. The second involves thinking cross-functionally, and the third focuses on elevating the strategic role of the board of directors.\nDuring our research, many next-generation leaders said that building a digitally savvy organization requires CxOs to work outside their comfort zones by thinking broadly about their role and the role of the C-suite, and by responding to change through teamwork and creative problem solving. Our study showed that 70% of executives from digitally leading companies embrace an experimentation mindset, compared to 47% from digitally emerging companies.1\nThis collaborative mindset is key to leading effectively during uncertainty.2 Among the marketing executives we spoke to, 80% of those from digitally leading companies agreed that their organization\u2019s most senior marketer is open to change, compared to 64% of those from digitally emerging companies.3 And leaders who combine traditional and nontechnical skills, like adaptability and intellectual curiosity, are in a better position to develop a culture of collaboration and respond effectively to constant change, particularly when it comes to marketing initiatives.\nAs one CTO said, \u201cChange drives people nuts, but people who embrace it are the ones who can actually help us in the future.\u201d4\nAnother way next-generation leaders help their companies stay flexible during uncertain times is by developing a holistic understanding of their entire organization and encouraging cross-functional teamwork. Executives who told us that their marketing leaders proactively monitored company initiatives happening in areas outside of marketing were also 32% more likely to say their company performed much better than their competitors in revenue growth.5 When leaders think cross-functionally, they create the opportunity for marketing, finance, sales, and IT teams to understand how each group\u2019s operations impact the collective and how they can work together to drive growth and innovation.\nWe also learned that this cross-functional collaboration should extend to the leadership teams themselves. Among digitally leading companies, 70% of the CxOs we surveyed stated that support across the C-suite and the board of directors was critical to successful digital transformation. Just 46% of executives from digitally emerging companies acknowledged this level of leadership support.6\nWhen senior leaders are aligned, they can offer their separate teams a clear, unified strategic vision and shared objectives, which can serve as a North Star during volatile moments. They can also encourage greater cross-functional collaboration by removing hierarchy and helping employees further develop soft skills like communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.\nBeyond ensuring C-suite alignment and collaboration, company leaders can future-proof their organizations by building and supporting an active, engaged board of directors.\nThis starts by ensuring that the board consists of the right people. For example, 82% of marketers from digitally leading companies said their board consists of people who can play a contributing role in supporting digital transformation, while only 42% of marketers from digitally emerging companies made the same claim.7 On top of this, board members who are still active in their professions can provide valuable external perspectives, such as spotting pitfalls, challenging assumptions, and bringing fresh ideas to the table.\nNext, leadership must consider the board\u2019s role in the wider organization. CxOs should encourage the board to move away from simple business signoffs and toward engaging with the company\u2019s overarching strategy. In our study, 1 in 3 senior-level marketers said that the board should push leadership to think creatively and take meaningful risks.8 This can help ensure that the company remains focused on digital innovation during disruptive times.\nWhile business leaders can\u2019t control rapid changes in the market, they very much define how their organizations respond and whether they continue to innovate. Next-generation leaders have proven their resilience and flexibility by stepping out of their comfort zones, fostering companywide collaboration, and empowering boards of directors to take an active, valuable role in their companies\u2019 overarching operations and strategies.\nLearn more about how the next generation of leaders drive growth on the route to digital readiness."

        "output": "It\u2019s no secret the media landscape has changed. This past year alone we\u2019ve seen a rise in short-form video and a breakout in AI-powered solutions. People are exposed to a wider variety of content and new ways to consume it, and one-size-fits-all campaigns are no longer enough.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners are blazing new trails by ditching the \u201cmatching luggage\u201d approach and accounting for people\u2019s unique needs. From tapping into YouTube trends to designing bespoke creative across formats, these advertisers expertly created unforgettable YouTube campaigns that resonated with audiences and drove results. Here are four lessons gleaned from the winners.\nLife insurance company MassMutual wanted to drive awareness around a bold topic: money. The brand recognized that conversations about finances are important but aren\u2019t always easy to have. It needed a creative way to grab attention and inspire people to tune into the topic. So it created a lighthearted campaign featuring diverse families having conversations about their financial futures amid unexpected events. The result was an intimate, fly-on-the-wall experience.\nMassMutual sought to make its ads unskippable by breaking the fourth wall, ingeniously utilizing the first six seconds to deliver different variations of the statement, \u201cThis is going to be extremely uncomfortable; you might want to skip this.\u201d This small-but-clever detail showed viewers that MassMutual was directly addressing them, creating a powerful connection.\nThe innovative strategy was wildly successful. In a head-to-head test, its 100% watch rate was 14 percentage points higher and costs per view (CPV) were 2X more cost efficient for creative featuring the made-for-YouTube 6-second add-on.\nSource: MassMutual Internal Data.\nLiv Lewis, EVP of EGAMI Group, praised MassMutual for their authenticity. \u201cNot only did they brilliantly embrace diversity of casting, they embraced diversity as it truly shows up in life.\u201d\nPopular blender brand BlendJet needed a campaign that could drive awareness with new customers and transform existing ones into enthusiastic brand advocates. Its strategy? Create compelling content and engage both audiences. BlendJet tapped into big YouTube trends that have stood the test of time. Assets included YouTube fan favorites such as cake or fakes, bewildering viewers with a blender disguised as a cake, and ASMR videos, soothing them with 10 hours of BlendJet assembly.\nBlendJet also mixed things up to appeal to the next generation of YouTube viewers, using the latest video trend: short form. The brand expertly integrated horizontal and vertical assets with long-form and short-form content to connect with audiences across various viewing preferences.\nReturn on advertising spend and scale allowed BlendJet to increase spend by 55% and helped drive a remarkable 66% revenue growth.\nAs Jonathan Daly, head of communications strategy at Droga5 raved, \u201cThis creative naturally utilizes the super power of YouTube as a social platform. It\u2019s designed to be highly addressable to the audience.\u201d\nOn a mission to rev up consideration, eBay Motors sought a platform that would inspire and excite audiences. That\u2019s why it raced toward YouTube, a go-to destination for inspiration. The brand teamed up with Google\u2019s Creative Works to identify trends and insights, landing on one key insight: People come to YouTube to go deep with the creators and content they love. With that in mind, eBay handed YouTube creators the keys and cocreated a masterfully produced five-part series that pitted modded cars against stock cars, with parts all purchased on eBay. Popular YouTube creator and race-car driver Collete Davis hosted each eight to 12 minute episode, featuring a special guest builder representing a subculture and product category.\nTo maximize viewership, eBay paired episode drops with paid YouTube advertising, and the results were remarkable. The brand grew its YouTube channel subscriber count from 700 to over 37,000 subscribers \u2014 606% above its goal \u2014 while generating more than 9 million views across episodes.\nSource: eBay Internal Data.\nDenise Truelove, global VP of brands at Mars Petcare, sang the team\u2019s praises. \u201cThis is a perfect example of a brand becoming entertainment.\u201d\nBeauty brand Dove also leaned into the power of long-form video to foster engagement. Over the years, Dove has fearlessly taken on the subject of real beauty to address timely issues. Recognizing how important parents\u2019 voices are in shaping children\u2019s self-esteem, the brand created nearly four-minute videos as part of its recent Dove Self-Esteem Project campaign. The videos featured face-mapping technology that put toxic advice into mothers\u2019 mouths, leaving viewers captivated.\nFor the initial push, Dove used YouTube Mastheads and in-feed video ads with a powerful thumbnail image to get people to click and watch the video. Additionally, it used video ad sequencing to prime viewers with a 15-second clip before serving the long-form version. The results spoke for themselves: 6.2 million lifted users associated Dove with raising awareness about the toxic advice girls are exposed to.\nAs Lex Beltrone, group creative director of FCB New York, put it, \u201cThis type of long-form video wouldn\u2019t feel right on any other platform but YouTube.\u201d\nBenjamin Moore, a premium paint manufacturer sold at local retailers around the world, faced a challenge. As businesses reopened and people ventured beyond their homes, home improvement took a back seat. Coupled with the economic headwinds, it was more important than ever for the company to support its local retailers. The brand took an innovative approach. It developed creative showcasing unique end cards for over 1,000 local retailers and paint colors, inspired by each region\u2019s stunning color palettes. Embracing the power of granular geotargeting, Benjamin Moore masterfully reached a small radius around a store\u2019s ZIP code in densely populated areas, while expanding reach in sparsely populated areas.\nIts colorful strategy paid off. Benjamin Moore achieved an average video completion rate of 55% across all regions, exceeding its 45% benchmark, and an impressive 30.4 million views, which was 215% over planned. With this captivating campaign, the brand flawlessly demonstrated that YouTube can help brands achieve a perfect balance of meticulous focus, expansive reach, and authentic user connection.\nSource: Benjamin Moore Internal Data.\nSimilarly, marketing automation platform Mailchimp embraced a full-funnel strategy to connect with small businesses that grapple with marketing challenges. Aiming to drive purchase intent, Mailchimp designed a whimsical campaign, featuring visuals like dancing rugs, to comically depict the confusion marketers often feel. Knowing that small business owners and decision-makers are at different stages of the funnel, it executed a highly tailored approach.\nAt the top of the funnel, it harnessed bumper ads and skippable ads, and tapped into audiences using custom affinity audience targeting to amplify brand reach. For the middle and bottom funnels, the brand shifted focus to driving engaged click volume and used Video action campaigns and audiences like custom intent. Lastly, it reached its most engaged viewers with a sign-up call to action. Moreover, Mailchimp embraced the changing landscape of how and where users watch its video content by harnessing the popularity of short-form video and updating vertical creative.\nThe highly personalized approach paid off, with a 4.2% increase in awareness and a remarkable 34% decrease in cost per paid sign-up year over year.\n\u201cThe ads helped not only empathize with the marketer\u2019s confusion but also gave them the tools and confidence to make tough marketing decisions\u201d marveled Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer and partner of Goodby Silverstein & Partners.\nThis year\u2019s YouTube Works Awards winners showcased exceptional talent in tapping into customer needs and implementing innovative strategies to cater to diverse interests. By using the full breadth of YouTube\u2019s capabilities, these brands transformed the platform into a dynamic canvas to showcase their creativity, tell their stories, and authentically connect with their audiences."

        "output": "AI is transforming marketing in profound and exciting ways. In my conversations with marketers, it\u2019s inspiring to hear how they\u2019re using AI to drive new customer connections, build high-quality creative, and make confident decisions grounded in predictive data.\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge, however, that AI can\u2019t drive marketing success by itself. AI is capable of multiplying business results and growth, but only when it\u2019s paired with human expertise. Marketers will continue to be essential in setting clear objectives \u2014 aligned to broader business goals \u2014 so that marketing impact can be accurately measured and decisions about where to invest can be more informed.\nWith that being said, the speed at which technology is evolving can leave even the most innovative marketers wondering whether their current strategies are enough to unlock AI\u2019s full potential and accelerate business growth. That\u2019s where we can help.\nFor several years at Google, we\u2019ve been building products that apply cutting-edge AI to help marketers navigate the rapidly changing landscape. In that time, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with thousands of brands and agencies to accelerate their business growth with AI, and through that experience we\u2019ve learned what works.\nHere are three key areas to prioritize for success with AI.\nA critical, often neglected aspect of AI is the causal relationship between the inputs you give to AI and the business outcomes it can generate. The fact is, AI learns from the data and experience that people provide. The higher quality the inputs, the better the results.\nMarketers who strengthen their measurement strategy and improve the quality of their audience and conversion data, for instance, can guide Google AI to better maximize their ROI. This is particularly true when consented first-party data is an input. Because it comes from direct customer relationships, the data is more durable and uniquely relevant to your business.\nRetailer H&M is a powerful example of how first-party data can be used to improve campaign performance. Last year, H&M\u2019s global head of paid media, Kristoffer Ullenius, and its global digital media analyst, Katarina Ahlner, shared more about their strategy. \u201cWhere we previously didn\u2019t optimize our paid Search campaigns towards acquiring new customers, we now started actively thinking about ways to reach them.\u201d This meant refocusing the strategy to attract consumers who wouldn\u2019t buy unless they were influenced by marketing.\nH&M began by deepening its understanding of the value of each customer segment, using a customer life-cycle model rooted in first-party data. This helped the team identify frequent buyers and put less emphasis on reaching them with paid Search, to focus instead on acquiring incremental new customers. Only when customers became less active would they use Search ads to reengage shoppers.\nThis approach, coupled with a shift to a customer-focused Target ROAS bidding strategy, helped H&M grow online revenue from paid Search by more than 70% year over year. According to Ullenius and Ahlner, \u201cAs the whole business moves towards being more customer-centric, it\u2019s been rewarding to see how much impact we can make by focusing our paid efforts on value.\u201d\nWith high-quality data in place, the next key focus area is using AI-powered campaigns to optimize your performance in real time. Every day, we\u2019re seeing that marketers who leverage Google AI can deliver more conversions and get more value out of their campaigns.\nPerformance Max, for example, is a goal-based campaign type that helps advertisers find untapped and incremental opportunities. Advertisers share their campaign goals and creative assets, and our technology automatically produces and runs a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google\u2019s channels.\nSamsung recently put Performance Max to the test across multiple markets to find untapped consumer demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\nAccording to Sandeep Bajpai, director and head of direct-to-consumer marketing at Samsung India, \u201cThe results were phenomenal. With AI-powered campaigns, we doubled our revenue without affecting our return on advertising spend too much.\u201d\nThe final area to prioritize is as critical as data and technology but wholly reliant on people. To get the most out of AI, you need a shared mindset that\u2019s anchored in experimentation and agility.\nIn a recent report created by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, in association with Google, industry leaders shared guidance on how to maximize AI as a business multiplier. Many of them emphasized the importance of a test, learn, and scale mindset, where your team can fail fast but learn quickly which new approaches can unlock profitable growth.\nAlex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, explained, \u201cTo protect profitability, experimentation should happen within a controlled environment. Cross-functional teams will need to nurture a test-and-learn culture where leaders can quickly adjust the plan when results don\u2019t come in as expected, or double down on what works.\u201d\nWhile AI solutions may be perceived as disruptive, they can be approached in a gradual manner. Embracing a culture of experimentation is a critical factor for organizations trying to reap the full benefits of AI.\nFor example, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica spent considerable time thoroughly testing AI-powered campaigns and analyzing the business impact of changes to bidding automation, campaign structure, and feed management. According to global performance marketing director Andrea Orlunghi, \u201cTesting new solutions allowed us to create a shared definition of success that spanned across departments.\u201d And its success was tangible. \u201cIn the past two years, combining a wide range of Google AI solutions contributed to nearly a 50% growth in the global online business of EssilorLuxottica.\u201d\nFostering agility by balancing early plans with an ability to pivot is equally important, especially in the context of planning, allocating, and optimizing digital budgets across channels.\nFor many companies, however, quickly shifting budgets to the biggest opportunities isn\u2019t easy. This is typically due to traditional silos in media channels that carried over to budgets and organizational structures. Unfortunately, these silos can be kryptonite for AI, limiting its ability to optimize and maximize performance.\nBy evolving your multichannel approach to be nimble enough to respond to consumer demands, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to capture incremental performance opportunities as they emerge. This process can be further bolstered by directly aligning marketing KPIs with business goals and partnering with your executive leadership to accurately quantify marketing\u2019s contribution based on key financial metrics. Research shows the results are worth it: Budget-agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.1\nIn sharing these AI essentials, it\u2019s my hope that you feel equipped to act today in ways that strengthen your marketing and accelerate business growth for years to come. If you\u2019re interested in learning how you can use Google AI solutions to supercharge your strategy, review the full checklist below and share it with your team."

        "output": "Kendall Kazor is a member of Google\u2019s People Development School for Googlers team, which produces Resilience at Google, a podcast examining the science behind resilience and high performance. This excerpted interview features a conversation from Season 2.\nCreativity can be hard to define, but it\u2019s an essential skill in today\u2019s workforce. Creativity helps us solve existing challenges and envision new opportunities, and it is considered an X-factor by many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies.\nAs the pace of work and connectivity steadily increases, how do we create the space we need to come up with our best ideas? Can we be creative and productive at the same time? And how do we keep the creative spark lit, even when we start to feel drained? These are questions we hear often from Googlers, but they are not questions unique to Google.\nIn April of this year, we launched a podcast series to help people better understand resilience, which we define as the ability to respond to and recover from stress. Every episode pairs neuroscientists and psychologists with mental performance coaches who discuss the science behind resilience, along with effective ways to react to change and other daily challenges.\nIn the first episode of the podcast\u2019s second season, we focus on creativity \u2014 specifically, how to recharge ourselves and maximize creativity during periods of high stress and transition. For this conversation, we were joined by digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush and associate professor of sport and performance psychology at Nottingham Trent University Dr. Mustafa Sarkar.\nWe\u2019re all striving to be our best, and often we equate that with being productive. Rahaf, you wrote a book called \u201cHustle and Float,\u201d which is a helpful concept for thinking about productivity. Can you explain it?\nRahaf Harfoush: \u201cHustle and float\u201d is a phrase borrowed from white-water rafting. It\u2019s the idea that, to have a good rafting trip, you need a mix of hustle and float. There\u2019s a period when you have to exert yourself to make the raft go where you want it to go, to move forward. But there are also periods when you have to lift your oar and let the river do the work. Too much of one or the other will ruin your trip. Too much hustle, and you\u2019ll get exhausted and make mistakes that can be dangerous. Too much float, and it\u2019s boring; you don\u2019t get where you want to go and are at the mercy of the river. The idea is that, in order to successfully navigate, we have to balance between when we do the work and when the river does the work. And that\u2019s easily applied to productivity culture: We\u2019re so accustomed to hustling, we don\u2019t remember how to float.\nCreativity helps solve big problems, which makes it a fundamental leadership capability we all need. Mustafa, when we consider team resilience, creativity is such a key part of navigating challenges and uncertainty. You study high-performance teams. What specifically have you noticed about managers and other leaders?\nMustafa Sarkar: Team learning is vital to resilience; teams that are on the same wavelength are better able to respond as a collective to difficult situations. Teams need time and space to perform in this way, and leaders are critical to shaping an environment and intentionally creating time and space for creativity. Effective leaders also have influence over the ideas that are generated.\nPrioritizing time and space for creativity is so important. But there\u2019s a misconception that prioritizing creativity comes at the expense of productivity. How do we overcome that to embrace the idea that focused work and detachment give teams a competitive advantage?\nHarfoush: Since we define productivity as continuous visual output, we tend to obsess over visible work performance. For most of us, the visible work \u2014 the presentation to the client, the final research report \u2014 is just a fraction of our process, maybe 25%. The remaining 75% is unseen, and so we think it\u2019s invisible to performance. And, from a resiliency perspective, we are accustomed to optimizing and getting drained as if it\u2019s an end state to be celebrated, rather than treating our creative energy as a sustainable resource to be renewed and replenished strategically.\nSarkar: There\u2019s an analogy about a cellphone battery: As humans, we often wait until we are at 5% energy to recharge, but we would never wait until our phone is at 5% battery power to charge it. We\u2019d probably start charging it at 30%. Why do we do it with our phones but not ourselves?\nWe know our best ideas and our best performance moments come after the rest, and we see that proven by professional athletes all the time. Why is it so hard to slow down?\nHarfoush: There\u2019s a myth that says your success is solely dependent on your ability to work hard. And that anytime you\u2019re not actively demonstrating that you\u2019re working hard, you are signaling that you\u2019re not deserving of your own success. In reality, we know that hard work can move the needle, yes, but there are so many other factors.\nSarkar: An important thing to consider when we talk about work devotion is identity and what fills your life outside of work. If you have multiple identities \u2014 if you\u2019re a father, a mother, a footballer, an exerciser, a cook, whatever it may be \u2014 you\u2019ll consider those aspects of your life very important. But if your identity is solely tied to work, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll see yourself and your success.\nOften there is a badge of honor around how hard we all work, especially among high performers. How can companies go about shifting that belief system?\nSarkar: Resilience is cultivated by design, not by default. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically, and that\u2019s why focusing on the work environment is so important. As a leader or manager, you must focus on proactively creating an environment where it is safe for people to speak up when they see things that aren\u2019t healthy, and creating opportunities where you can hold up your hand and acknowledge your own mistakes.\nHarfoush: To build on that, it\u2019s important to consider questions that contribute to environment: What does success look like here? What behaviors do we hold up as aspirational? How do we measure performance? How do we define performance?\nI also encourage clients to start with small experiments. Make hypotheses about what you think you can prove through experimentation. Maybe you\u2019ll see better strategic thinking and fewer mistakes when people aren\u2019t sleep deprived and overstressed. Get the data and build on what you learn.\nOne of the top questions we get from people managers at Google has been: What can I do now to increase my team\u2019s resilience and productivity down the road? What\u2019s your advice?\nSarkar: Resilience boils down to cultivating relationships, particularly because of remote and hybrid work. There\u2019s a saying that \u201cstrangers can\u2019t team,\u201d and many of us are in a situation now where we don\u2019t know our teammates. Working to cultivate relationships and shared values is more critical than ever.\nHarfoush: Productivity is a reflection of a system, and it can be anything that you want. So if you want to increase your team\u2019s productivity, then it\u2019s critical to specify what that means. Is it increased time for deep work? More periods of intense collaboration? Eliminating distractions through prioritization?\nAnother thing for managers to think about is anti-fragility \u2014 not just helping your team be productive and resilient through disruption, but using the disruption to grow and be better. As strategic thinkers, we have to be adaptive and responsive, and challenge assumptions and evolve. All of those things require a different relationship to change. So as leaders, we must really get to know ourselves, our creativity, our energy, and what drains and replenishes us.\nDownload and listen to the full conversation on Google Podcasts or wherever you find your favorite shows."
