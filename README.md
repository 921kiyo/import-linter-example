# Python Import Linter Example

This is a code example to demonstrate an edge case written in [my blog post](https://921kiyo.com/python-import-linter/).


First, install dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run import linter to get the linting result.
```bash
lint-imports
```
